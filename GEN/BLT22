             HOW TO USE THE USENET GATEWAY ON THE TOOL SHOP
             ==============================================

WHAT IS USENET:

Usenet: a world-wide e-mail network linking many universities, governments,
businesses and bbs systems such as The Tool Shop. There are, at the time of
this writing, over 4,000 newgroups, (read newsgroup as 'Conference'),
covering just about any conceivable subject in the universe.

The _MAJOR_ difference in E-mail on Usenet as compared to the average BBS
is that in the newsgroups, all mail is public and is always addressed to
'ALL'. Do not post in a newgroup unless it TRULY WILL BE OF INTEREST TO
EVERYONE READING THAT NEWSGROUP!  You message goes to every single usenet
site carrying that newgroup around the world!  Usenet administration gets
very upset if messages are posted which are not of general interest to all
those reading the newsgroup.  If you wish to reply to an individual who has
posted, send your message via the ROSENET/INTERNET GATEWAY.

The following instructions only apply to conferences that are part of the
Usenet network.

On The Tool Shop there is a conference that is of particular importance when
using the Usenet Gateway:

    - Conference 42 [UnixUseNet] is the Usenet Gateway support conference and
      is where any questions or comments regarding the use of the gateway
      should be placed.  Everyone using the Usenet news groups should add
      Conf. #42 to their offline mail packets.

Also note that, on The Tool Shop, the Usenet conferences are available only to
those who are using the RoseMail/RoseReader combination, the reason for this
is the ever present need/temptation to correspond with an "individual" and
that cannot properly be done in Usenet news Groups, but it can be done with
Internet E-Mail, hence the need for Rosemail/RoseReader. The RoseReader
offline mail reader is available to all Tool Shop Members at the top of File
Area 8, it handles the Usenet news groups just fine and, when used with the
RoseMail door, has the added advantage of providing the Internet E-Mail.  A
"Tool Shop specific" version of RoseReader is available for a free trial to
all Tool Shop Members.  Just go into Door 1 and type 'REG'. If you select the
'free' Key, you would fill out the application and within hours your E-mail
Key will be here waiting for you.  If you decide you want the 'Platinum'
version which will unlock all the enhanced features such as file transfers,
magazines, and 'unattended' mode operation, you would call back in four to
five working days, go into Door 1 and type 'KEY'. Your Platinum Key will be
sent via a download to you.  Note: some of these enhanced features are not yet
available on the network, but may be in the future.

When sending messages remember that Usenet is a global network, and as a
result take into the consideration the cost of echoing your message around
the world.  If your message is only of interest to a specific person then
send that person a private message via Internet. Remember that all private
e-mail, both incoming and outgoing, is via the Rosenet/Internet gateways.
If your reply is of general interest then send a public message, but please
think about the quoting of the previous message, delete any of the quoting
that is not relevant to your reply. Keep quotes AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE!

Your address on The Tool Shop is first.last@rose.com  where the 'first' and
'last' are the names you use to logon to The Tool Shop.  Your address is
automatically added on to all your outgoing mail by the Usenet Gateway.


IMPORTANT NOTICE:  Members of The Tool Shop are not allowed to access or join
                   list servers, mail-servers, mailing lists or request
                   files from FTP sites. Use of these services can overload
                   the gateway and can result in the termination of your
                   membership without refund, (that's what happens to The
                   Tool Shop itself if we don't pay attention to this), there
                   are plans to make these sevices available at extra cost,
                   but that will not happen for a while yet.

     List-server / Mailing List : These are automatic programs running
     at another computer site.  When you subscribe to the list-server, any
     mail that is sent to the list-server (mailing list) will be broadcast
     with a copy of each message being mailed to each person on the
     subscription list.  The result could be many copies of the same
     messages to be brought onto a system (such as Rose).

     Mail-server : This is an automatic program that will take requests for
     file(s) and send the file(s) as personal mail to the person requesting
     the file(s).  This again is a problem when it comes to overloading a
     system with personal mail.


    If you are sending mail to someone on Compuserve, you would put the
    person's Compuserve identification code in the 'name' field so it
    would look like the following:

                       To: 70511.1234@compuserve.com

    Compuserve ID's use commas between the numbers above. It is
    _EXTREMELY_ important you change the comma to a period as in the
    example above. If you don't, your message will be sucked into a
    black hole!


HOW TO SEND A PUBLIC MESSAGE IN A USENET CONFERENCE:

1.  Make sure you are in the conference you wish your message to appear in
    and that your message REALLY IS OF INTEREST TO ALL.

2.  Address your message to ALL

3.  Preface your subject with UN: , thus if your subject was TEST then you
    would put UN: TEST in the subject field.

4.  Enter your message as you normally would starting on line 1.

Below is an example of a public message:

==========================================================================
To:   ALL
From: JOHN SMITH
Subj: UN: Example Message          Conf:    345 OS2Misc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an example (using the comp.os.os2.misc newsgroup) of how to 
send a public message via Usenet.  All you would have to do is make 
sure that you change the conference number to match the conference you 
want to put your message in.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that it is important that you place the message in the conference 
you want it to appear in.

The space after the UN: is VERY important.
