                               | files (with .EXE and .COM extensions).
                               | PKLITE will compress these executable files
                               | so they will require much less disk space yet
                               | will still run normally.  PKLITE compresses
                               | your files much like PKZIP, but it adds a
                               | small amount of extraction code at the
                               | beginning of the executable file.  When you
                               | run an application that has been compressed
                               | with PKLITE, the program will automatically
                               | be expanded into memory and run.  The
                               | compressing process does not change the
                               | operation of the program at all, it merely
                               | reduces the disk space required to store it.
