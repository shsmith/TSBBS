                PLEASE READ BULLETIN #22 FOR USENET GUIDELINES!

 Usenet: a world-wide e-mail network linking many universities, governments,
 businesses and bbs systems such as The Tool Shop. There are, at the time of
 this writing, over 4,000 newgroups, (read newsgroup as 'Conference'), covering
 just about any conceivable subject in the universe.

 The MAJOR difference in E-mail on Usenet as compared to the average BBS is
 that in the newsgroups, all mail is public and is always addressed to 'ALL'.
 Do not post in a newgroup unless it TRULY WILL BE OF INTEREST TO EVERYONE
 READING THAT NEWSGROUP!  Your message goes to every single usenet site
 carrying that newgroup around the world! Usenet administration gets very upset
 if messages are posted which are not of general interest to all those reading
 the newsgroup.  If you wish to reply to an individual who has posted, send
 your message via the ROSENET/INTERNET GATEWAY.

RoseNet provides the means for informal BBS systems to provide true person to
person communication.  But, RoseNet is far more than that. It provides the
ability to connect seamlessly with other world-wide nets such a Internet. The
Rosenet routed private mail and Internet gateway features require the use of
RoseMail/RoseReader.

 THadmin       214 ùThrobNet: This is the Network Administration conference.
                    This is where we discuss ADMINISTRATIVE issues only. Change
                    of feeds, missing systems, and other network related
                    problems. General sysop chatter should go into SysOp's
                    conf.

 THadultIss    201 ùThrobNet: Issues is for the discussion of serious adult
                    issues, whether or not they are of a sexual nature.  Even
                    political stuff is okay in here.  Any newsworthy items can
                    be posted here as well.

 THansi        200 ùThrobNet: Alright all of you perverted ANSI artists. Let's
                    see what what you can show us!

 THaskJudi     202 ùThrobNet: Ask our medical technician any of your questions.
                    Judi is not bashful, and will answer any of those "hard to
                    ask" questions. Please be advised thou, her advice is just
                    that, advice. Please consult your physician for more
                    specific help. Moderator: Judi Moon

 THconStory    203 ùThrobNet: This conference is hosted by The Consultant.
                    Here we organize user-developed round-robin stories.  In
                    their specified order, users take turns posting the next
                    chapter in whichever story they are signed up for.  If you
                    want to sign up for a story, leave a message for The
                    Consultant. Do NOT take it upon yourself to add the next
                    chapter unless it's your turn - it'll just make things
                    confusing. This conference is NOT for user's writing
                    samples or favorite text files - that belongs in Writings
                    (see below). Moderator: The Consultant

 THdrRude      204 ùThrobNet: Got a problem? Need advice? Ask Dr. Rude, but
                    don't expect a serious answer! Moderator: Dr. Rude

 THfantasy     205 ùThrobNet: Originally, this was going to be a conference
                    where users would post detailed descriptions of their
                    fantasies.  It still is, but it turned out people liked to
                    comment about each others fantasies, and then that
                    naturally progresses into Modem Sex-type messages.  See
                    SexTalk for an example of Modem Sex.  Friendly chatter and
                    stuff like that do NOT belong in Fantasy, and should be
                    moved to General or Violet's. Moderator: Valeria

 THfetishes    206 ùThrobNet: Any special fetish you have?  If so, talk about
                    it in here.  You can also play out Fetish fantasies here.
                    From foot fetishes to bathroom habits, it belongs in here.
                    You never know what'll pop up in Fetish.

 THsmBDds      218 ùThrobNet: Discussion of S&M, D&S, B&D, stuff like that.
                    Mistresses, Masters, slaves, they all show up here
                    eventually.  Any topic relating to this is perfectly suited
                    for this conference.

 THgay         207 ùThrobNet: Homosexual discussions.  You don't have to be gay
                    to participate, but the conversation should deal with
                    issues and topics concerning homosexuality or living the
                    homosexual lifestyle.

 THgeneral     208 ùThrobNet: Anything goes in here.  If it doesn't fit in
                    another conference, or even if it does, you can talk about
                    it here. As a matter of fact, if you are uncertain about
                    how a certain topic fits within the network, this
                    conference is your best bet.  Messages that are off-topic
                    in other conferences will be moved to this conference by
                    sysops or administration when necessary.

                    content. It doesn't matter whether it's your boss, your
                    wife, that stupid guy in front of you on the highway this
                    morning, that idiotic insurance company, anything.  Go
                    ahead and scream about it.  You can also bash and swear at
                    other ThrobNet users here without fear of punishment.

 THjokes       210 ùThrobNet: Adult or just plain funny humorous crap goes
                    here.  Please try to keep any non-jokes conversation to a
                    minimum, or move to another conference ASAP.  There are no
                    rules about what jokes you can or cannot tell, if it's
                    funny go ahead and spit it out.

 PE_All_Debate  59 ùPlanetEarth Net: Dedicted solely to "intellectual debates".
                    We expect respect from and to all participants.  Those who

 PE_Chit_Chat!  47 ùPlanetEarth Net: Sometimes we all need a place to go to
                    chew the fat. Many folks will make new friends in PEN  so

                    threat? Is our industrial technology changing to clean up
                    our environment? These are all valid questions but we want

                    are so many kids dropping out and what is being done about
                    it?  What is the college outlook going to be like for our

 PE_Political!  58 ùPlanetEarth Net: All topics from government waste, red tape
                    and gridlock. In the US alone, billions of dollars a year
                    are being wasted on unnecessary "pet projects" that your
                    senators and congressmen WANT to keep going!  Government is

                    are all facts, this forum is devoted to the "What can we do
                    about it?" mentality.  This forum is NOT for debates (see
                    PE_All_Debate). In what countries is government a less

                    run?

                    way men and women communicate with each other. Why's being

                    divorce or a spouse dies? What groups are there that can
                    help?

 PE_Religions!  55 ùPlanetEarth Net: This is not a debate forum for comparing
                    one religion to another.  This is also not a place for
                    recruiting or preaching! What this forum IS for is to
                    discuss how to get the "family" back to church, and what
                    role does the church, temple, mosque or synagogue play in
                    the community?  Is the church doing all that it can to
                    bring family back to it's fold, and if not, what more can
                    or should it be doing?

 PE_TV_Impact!  60 ùPlanetEarth Net: What is the impact of television and the
                    movies having on our society?  Do MTV, Beavis and Butthead,
                    Madonna, or violence in TV and movies present a danger to
                    the youth of the world? What are the network exec's  and
                    movie moguls doing to change their image, or should they?

 PE_Technology  53 ùPlanetEarth Net: What are the recent science and technology
                    breakthroughs? What will they mean for you?

 PE_Wld_At_War  57 ùPlanetEarth Net: Who's at war with who and why? What's
                    going on in Somalia, Bosnia, Isreal or any other area that
