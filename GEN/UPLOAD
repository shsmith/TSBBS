                               | format. The compressed SpchComp files

                               | extracted out of the original signal, based
                               | on the knowledge of the production of human
                               | speech. SpchComp uses a technique known as
                               | CELP (Code Excited Linear Prediction). The
                               | compression is lossy, but very good quality
                               | can be achieved. The compression ratio is
                               | about 25:1, or 4% of the original size. A
                               | PCM-WAV file of size 25K, for example, will
                               | therefore be reduced to 1K.
