                PLEASE READ BULLETIN #22 FOR USENET GUIDELINES!

 Usenet: a world-wide e-mail network linking many universities, governments,
 businesses and bbs systems such as The Tool Shop. There are, at the time of
 this writing, over 4,000 newgroups, (read newsgroup as 'Conference'), covering
 just about any conceivable subject in the universe.

 The MAJOR difference in E-mail on Usenet as compared to the average BBS is
 that in the newsgroups, all mail is public and is always addressed to 'ALL'.
 Do not post in a newgroup unless it TRULY WILL BE OF INTEREST TO EVERYONE
 READING THAT NEWSGROUP!  Your message goes to every single usenet site
 carrying that newgroup around the world! Usenet administration gets very upset
 if messages are posted which are not of general interest to all those reading
 the newsgroup.  If you wish to reply to an individual who has posted, send
 your message via the ROSENET/INTERNET GATEWAY.
