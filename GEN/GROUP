@X0FWelcome to PCBoard Group Chat@X07

In Group Chat, there many channels available so that more than one chat may
take place at any given time.  When you join Group Chat you must decide which
'@X0Cchannel@X07' you wish to participate in.  You can join an on-going discussion,
or use the CALL command to invite others to a new topic on an unused channel.

People can read what you type as you type it.  However, only one person has
the "focus".  The "focus" is used so that only one person can be typing while
others, if they *do* type, do not interrupt.  However, you *may* type ahead!
PCBoard will allow up to one line of text while waiting for the focus.

If you use Split Screen mode, you may then type as much as you want prior to
hitting ENTER.  It is recommended that you use the NOECHO command so that when
you do hit ENTER the keystrokes will not be sent back to you.  NOECHO also
removes the one line limit in case you don't get the focus right away.
CAUTION:  In split screen mode, the only way to access commands is to press
ESC, type the command letters and *then* press the ENTER key.  If you press
ESC and then press ENTER to send the ESC the command prompt will accept your
ENTER key as a cancel for command mode.  Example:  press ESC, type MENU, then
press the ENTER key.
