                 WHY USE THE ROSEMAIL/ROSEREADER COMBINATION?
                 ============================================
                 
 When you use the [J]oin command, you will see a list of conferences that
 are carried here on The Tool Shop; every conference on that list has the
 network it belongs to.
 
 All of the public Rosenet and U'NI-net conferences may be accessed via any
 mail door, and any offline mail reader will work with them.
 
 The Rosenet routed private mail feature requires RoseMail/RoseReader.
 
 The Rosenet/Internet gateway feature requires RoseMail/RoseReader, this
 gateway includes the Internet/Compuserve gateway so private messages may be
 exchanged with people on CIS, it is also the gateway for private mail to
 people in the Usenet conferences; since all Usenet messages MUST be addressed
 to ALL, the Rosenet/Internet gateway is the solution to that network
 restriction.

 All of the Usenet newsgroups, (conferences), require the use of the RoseMail
 door and the RoseReader offline mail reader. (The tagline from your offline
 mail reader must show that you are using RoseReader).  If you type NET in the
 RoseMail door and select 2, (Usenet), you will see no conferences at all
 unless I have turned them on for you after determining that you are using
 RoseReader and you have read bulletin 8, then RoseMail/RoseReader MUST be
 used for all messages written in the Usenet newsgroups.
 
 As you can see from the above, if you do not want to use the Usenet
 conferences or the Rosenet private routed mail, or the Rosenet/Internet
 gateway, then you do NOT have to use RoseReader, you can still use the
 RoseMail door if you want to because it works perfectly for all of the normal
 QWKmail funtions too.
