ONCEADAY.ZIP    26596  11-24-94  Allows a batch file (or portion thereof) to
                               | run just once a day. It's useful when you
                               | want something to take place only once each
                               | calendar day, even if the original batch file
                               | is called numerous times during the day. When
                               | run the first time during a given day,
                               | ONCEADAY will return a DOS ERRORLEVEL of 3.
                               | Each time it is run thereafter, it will
                               | return an errorlevel of 0 - until the date
                               | changes. Then it will return an ERRORLEVEL of
                               | 3 again, the first time it's run on that
                               | date.
