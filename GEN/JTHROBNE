 THadmin       214 ùThrobNet: This is the Network Administration conference.
                    This is where we discuss ADMINISTRATIVE issues only. Change
                    of feeds, missing systems, and other network related
                    problems. General sysop chatter should go into SysOp's
                    conf.

 THadultIss    201 ùThrobNet: Issues is for the discussion of serious adult
                    issues, whether or not they are of a sexual nature.  Even
                    political stuff is okay in here.  Any newsworthy items can
                    be posted here as well.

 THansi        200 ùThrobNet: Alright all of you perverted ANSI artists. Let's
                    see what what you can show us!

 THaskJudi     202 ùThrobNet: Ask our medical technician any of your questions.
                    Judi is not bashful, and will answer any of those "hard to
                    ask" questions. Please be advised thou, her advice is just
                    that, advice. Please consult your physician for more
                    specific help. Moderator: Judi Moon

 THconStory    203 ùThrobNet: This conference is hosted by The Consultant.
                    Here we organize user-developed round-robin stories.  In
                    their specified order, users take turns posting the next
                    chapter in whichever story they are signed up for.  If you
                    want to sign up for a story, leave a message for The
                    Consultant. Do NOT take it upon yourself to add the next
                    chapter unless it's your turn - it'll just make things
                    confusing. This conference is NOT for user's writing
                    samples or favorite text files - that belongs in Writings
                    (see below). Moderator: The Consultant

 THdrRude      204 ùThrobNet: Got a problem? Need advice? Ask Dr. Rude, but
                    don't expect a serious answer! Moderator: Dr. Rude

 THfantasy     205 ùThrobNet: Originally, this was going to be a conference
                    where users would post detailed descriptions of their
                    fantasies.  It still is, but it turned out people liked to
                    comment about each others fantasies, and then that
                    naturally progresses into Modem Sex-type messages.  See
                    SexTalk for an example of Modem Sex.  Friendly chatter and
                    stuff like that do NOT belong in Fantasy, and should be
                    moved to General or Violet's. Moderator: Valeria

 THfetishes    206 ùThrobNet: Any special fetish you have?  If so, talk about
                    it in here.  You can also play out Fetish fantasies here.
                    From foot fetishes to bathroom habits, it belongs in here.
                    You never know what'll pop up in Fetish.

 THsmBDds      218 ùThrobNet: Discussion of S&M, D&S, B&D, stuff like that.
                    Mistresses, Masters, slaves, they all show up here
                    eventually.  Any topic relating to this is perfectly suited
                    for this conference.

 THgay         207 ùThrobNet: Homosexual discussions.  You don't have to be gay
                    to participate, but the conversation should deal with
                    issues and topics concerning homosexuality or living the
                    homosexual lifestyle.

 THgeneral     208 ùThrobNet: Anything goes in here.  If it doesn't fit in
                    another conference, or even if it does, you can talk about
                    it here. As a matter of fact, if you are uncertain about
                    how a certain topic fits within the network, this
                    conference is your best bet.  Messages that are off-topic
                    in other conferences will be moved to this conference by
                    sysops or administration when necessary.

                    content. It doesn't matter whether it's your boss, your
                    wife, that stupid guy in front of you on the highway this
                    morning, that idiotic insurance company, anything.  Go
                    ahead and scream about it.  You can also bash and swear at
                    other ThrobNet users here without fear of punishment.

                    rules about what jokes you can or cannot tell, if it's
                    funny go ahead and spit it out.
