   SYSTEM UPGRADE. The original 386DX/20 has been dedicated as a file server
   (with UPS) and all large hard drives have been removed from BBS node
   machines.  This change made quite a large difference in system performance
   and reliability.

   development and customer support.  I should now be able to answer mail or
   run OS/2 or Unix without taking the BBS down in the process.

   v.32bis modems have been installed.  The system now provides 1 free line,
