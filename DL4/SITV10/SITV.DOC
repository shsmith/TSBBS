SETV - StuffIt File Lister; S.H.Smith 7-11-89

This is a simple verbose-listing utility for Macintosh .SIT files.

I don't know what "folders" are, so it probably won't work on files that
contain them.  I also don't know the format of the encoded date/time
stamps.  If someone could kindly forward this information to the Tool
Shop I would appreciate it.
