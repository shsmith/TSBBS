OVERVIEW
   EZSpell will scan a document and make a list of all unique words that
   it contains.  It will then compare these words to the contents of
   it's dictionary file, EZSPELL.DCT.  You will then be given a list of
   all words that were not found in the dictionary.  You can decide if
   you want to add words to the dictionary, or change them in your
   document.  EZSpell will show you the unknown words in the actual
   context of your document.  Your document is then updated as needed.
   The dictionary is also updated if needed.


FILES
   EZS.EXE         The EZSpell program.
   EZSPELL.DCT     The dictionary.
   EZSPELL.DOC     The documentation for EZSpell.
   EZCLEAN.EXE     A utility for cleaning out the dictionary.


INSTRUCTIONS
   To run EZSpell, you must have this disk in your currently logged
   drive. EZSpell looks for the dictionary file, EZSPELL.DCT first in
   the current directory, and then in all of the search PATHs. To check
   spelling in the file C:FOO.TXT, you would type:

      EZS C:\DIR\FOO.TXT

   EZSpell will read through your file, giving you a count of how many
   lines and words that is has examined. After the whole document has
   been scanned, it begins to read the dictionary. While reading the
   dictionary you will be given a count of how many dictionary words
   have been scanned, and how many words were "unknown".


   After the dictionary scanning is completed, you will be allowed to
   "review" the list of unknown words. You will be given these possible
   actions:

     ADD
         This word will be added to the dictionary.

      CORRECT
         Change the spelling of this word.  You will be asked to enter
         the corrected spelling for this word.  EZSpell will go through
         your document and change the spelling for you.  

      MARK
         The word is marked so that you can manually correct it. This
         may be useful when you are not sure of how the word was used,
         and need to do more than a simple spelling change.  This is the
         only option that some spelling  checkers  give  you.  A marked
         word will show up in your document with brackets around it,
         like this: [incerrect].

      IGNORE
         Just ignore this word.  Don't add it to the dictionary, and
         don't change it in your document.  

      LAST
         This option jumps to the last unknown word.  Use this if you
         prefer to go backwards through the wordlist with the [PREVIOUS]
         command, or if you want to ignore all of the remaining unknown
         words.

      NEXT
         This option will display the next context in which this word
         is used in the document.

      PREVIOUS
         This option lets you back-up in case you change your mind about 
         what to do with a word.  Very handy!  


   You select the action you want by pressing the first letter of the
   action name.  

   Once you have gone through all of the words, EZSpell will update your 
   document.  As the file is updated, you will be given a display
   showing the number of lines processed.  Any changes made in your
   document will also be shown, as they are made.  EZSpell saves the
   original version of your file so you can "un-correct" it, if needed.

   After your document has been updated, new words will be added to the
   dictionary file.  EZSpell saves a copy of the original dictionary
   file.  This might come in handy if you run out of disk space.  


LIMITATIONS
   EZSpell probably won't work on files that contain funny control
   characters or other non-ascii characters (like WordStar files).
   Please convert these files into ascii before you use EZSpell.

   EZSpell always keeps backups of your original document and dictionary
   files.  If you run out of disk space while updating a file, the
   program will be aborted.  It is then up to you to rename the backup
   file to restore the original data.

   EZSpell can work on any size document, limited only by how much
   memory you have.  It takes about 100 bytes of memory for each unique
   word in the document.  

   There is no limit to dictionary size.   Words and lines can not be
   longer than 40 characters.  Lines can not be longer than 255
   characters.
