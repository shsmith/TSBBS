D6801 is a compiler for a small "pascal like" language.  It generates
motorola 6801 assembly language, which can be executed by the
RUN6801 interpreter.

The code generator and optimization modules are also provided for
the 8080 and the 6502, although there is no way to execute the object
code for these machines.

Several sample programs in the "D" language are proveded.

Full source code is provided (in turbo pascal).


I hereby place this material into the public domain.
