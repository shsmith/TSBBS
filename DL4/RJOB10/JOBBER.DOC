'RJOB10.ARC' implements a 'remote job execution' facility.  This means 
that you can start a program on the 386-20 cpu while you are running a 
different program on one of the other nodes on the net.  The 'program' 
in this case would consist of a single 'copy' command to move a file 
from the CD or WORK (local to the JOBBER machine) to a network 
directory. 

This utility is very general; you can use it to run ANY program that does 
not need user intervention.  You can even request multiple programs to 
be run as time allows, while you go off and do other things... true 
MULTI-processing. 


Installation
------------

The JOBRES.EXE program should be started on the machine with the CD or
WORM attached.  JOBRES will patiently sit back and wait for another CPU
to give it a job to do.   The config file JOBBER.CNF controls what 
directory is used for the 'job queue' (list of waiting jobs).   It also 
allows you to assign "logical names" to physical devices on the JOBBER 
CPU.  So, you can access the second CD as CD2: from any machine on the
net.

The REX.EXE program is called from any other CPU to Remote EXecute a 
program or command.  REX is used when ever you want to ask the JOBBER 
cpu to execute a copy command, or a tape backup, or just about anything 
else.   REX also uses the JOBBER.CNF file to specify the 'job queue' 
directory.  You can specify the REX confix file with the SET command:
   SET JOBBER=c:\dir\jobber.cnf

Once you have 'jobber' running, you can request a CD file with a command 
like this: 
   rex copy CD2:\sub1\file.arc m:\myfile

I will document this in more detail, but I hope you're getting the idea 
of what this is.  We can build a "shell" around these programs to make 
the multi-processing look more friendly to the end user.  Also, specific 
"hooks" can be added to prodoor to make the LIB or similar function work 
with this facility. 


Sample configuration file:
-------------------------

   ;
   ; jobber.cnf - remote job executive configuration file
   ;

   ;--job queue directory - this network directory will be used for
   ;--passing all job requests;  best performance if on a ramdisk.
   ;--directory must not have any other files in it!
   j:\jobque

   ;--delay between job polls, clock ticks (approx 18 per second)
   10

   ;--jobber name replacement table
   ;
   ; This is a table of macro replacements.  These macros are expanded as jobs are
   ; executed.  This facility allows you to assign logical names to physical
   ; devices, programs, directories, etc.
   ;
   ROM1:=e:
   ROM2:=f:
   WORM:=g:

   ;
   ; Example job requests:
   ;    rex copy WORM:\dl5\moon.arc m:\tmp
   ;       -- copies the file g:\dl5\moon.arc into network directory m:\tmp
   ;       -- for remote access.
   ;
