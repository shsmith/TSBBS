CP - Unix-like file copy, (v4.0, 7-13-89)
Copyright (C) 1987, 1989 Samuel H. Smith; All rights reserved.

'CP' is a small file copy utility.   It works much like the DOS copy
command and is patterned after the Unix facility by the same name.

Usage:
  cp [-U] [-R] [-2] SOURCE DEST
  cp SOURCE1 SOURCE2 ... SOURCEn DEST
  cp SOURCE

  -U updates destination only if source is newer
        This option causes CP to replace older files, but to skip
        copying then the destination is the same as or newer than the
        source file.

  -E copy only if destination exists
        This option allows you to replace existing files, but not copy
        files that are not already present in the destination directory.

  -R allows read-only destination to be replaced
        This option allows you to replace a file that is flagged as
        read-only.  The new file will also be read-only.  This is useful
        when updating EXE files in a directory that is entirely read-
        only (such as a common directory on a network).

  -2 reduces buffering to 2k blocks
        This option reduces the I/O buffering from the normal 32k
        buffers to a small 2k buffer.  You may find this option useful
        when copying to or from a floppy disk under a network or
        timeshare system, since smaller blocks will reduce system
        loading.


Examples:
  cp a:*.arc
        ;copies all .arc files into current dir

  cp /pcb/main/*.* /pcb/gen/*.* d:/backup
        ;copies files from two directories into backup directory

  cp -r program.exe c:\library
        ;copies file program.exe to library directory, allowing the
        ;library copy to be read-only.

  cp -u *.* c:\backup
        ;copies all files to backup directory.  skips copying files that
        ;are already present in backup area, but copies missing or newer
        ;files.

  cp -r -u *.exe c:\bin
        ;updates all .exe files in c:\bin, also allowing destinations to
        ;be replaced if flagged read-only


Cp works just like the DOS copy command, with the following exceptions:
  - Both / and \ are allowed as directory delimiters
  - Multiple source files may be specified
  - Network file sharing is supported
  - Files cannot be renamed during a copy (I.E. DEST must be a directory)


No time to write documentation!
Maybe a longer doc file in the next release.
