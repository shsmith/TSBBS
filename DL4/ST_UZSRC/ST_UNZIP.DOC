                             EXTRACTING A ZIP FILE

              This section will describe some simple examples, illustrating
          the command format for extracting files from a ZIP file.

          ||============================================================||
          ||                                                            ||
          ||                                                            ||
          ||                 How to Extract a ZIP file                  ||
          ||                                                            ||
          || A ZIP file is one which holds much information in a        ||
          || greatly reduced space.  Use the ST_UNZIP program to        ||
          || extract compressed files from a ZIP file.  An entire ZIP   ||
          || file can be extracted, or a specific file  can be          ||
          || delegated to be extracted.                                 ||
          ||                                                            ||
          || There are four main parameters on the ST_UNZIP command:    ||
          ||                                                            ||
          || 1. The command options           |  letter commands        ||
          ||                                  |  example: -v=view files ||
          ||                                                            ||
          || 2. The ZIP file name             |  zipfile.zip            ||
          ||                                                            ||
          || 3. Selected file to be extracted |  foo.txt                ||
          ||                                                            ||
          || 4. The destination where you want| Default = directory     ||
          ||    the extracted information to  | where program is started||
          ||    be located (optional)         |                         ||
          ||                                                            ||
          ||  Examples:                                                 ||
          ||                                                            ||
          ||    x zipfile.zip  A:\                                      ||
          ||                                                            ||
          || This command will extract all the files in the ZIP file    ||
          || zipfile.zip.  It will locate extracted files to the A      ||
          || drive.                                                     ||
          ||                                                            ||
          ||                                                            ||
          ||    i  A:\zipfile.zip  foo.c                                ||
          ||                                                            ||
          || In this example the ZIP file located in the A drive will   ||
          || be extracted  to the drive and/or folder ST_UNZIP is run   ||
          || from, this is the default.  Only the foo.c file will be    ||
          || extracted.                                                 ||
          ||                                                            ||
          ||     xo \collect\zipfile.zip  A:\                           ||
          ||                                                            ||
          || In this example, the path location of the ZIP file is      ||
          || specified.   The files will be extracted to the A drive.   ||
          || With the 'xo' option, any file on the A drive with the same||
          || name will be overwritten _without_ asking for user         ||        
          || confirmation.                                              ||

                       DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND OPTIONS


              The command options used in extracting a ZIP file will be
          explained in detail in this section.  

          - The command options must be the first parameter on the
            command line.

          - The first filename listed on the command line will be
            interpreted as the ZIP file to be extracted.  When using
            the 'i' option, the next filename will be interpreted as
            the specific file to be extracted from the zipfile. 
          
          - The command can be typed using either upper case, lower
            case, or any combination.

          - All command options can be preceded by a '-' character
            (i.e. -v).  At present there is no need to use this
            character.  This flag will be used in future versions 
            of ST_UNZIP.

          - Unrelated options of ST_UNZIP cannot be combined.

          - The default values for the command line are as follows:


            1. If no extension is specified for the ZIP file the .zip
               extension is assumed.

            2. If no destination is specified for the extracted files, they
               will be located in directory that the program is being run
               from.

            3. If no file specs (filenames without wildcards) are
               listed, the default is all(*.*).


              The following table lists all the options valid with the
          PKZIP command.  A brief summary is also given in the table.  The
          options are explained in detail, along with programming examples,
          following the table.

                          Table 1   ST_UNZIP Command Options
          ==============================================================

          OPTION         SUMMARY

          -c[m]          Extracts a particular file to the console or
                         with 'm' option extracts to console a screen
                         full at a time, and more.

          -i[o]          Extract a particular file to disk.  

          -p             Extracts a particular text file to a printer.

                         files in the ZIP.

          -x[o]          Extracts files from the ZIP file.
             
             o           Overwrite existing files:  
                         Used along with either 'x' or 'i' option.    
             
          -t             reads each file in zipfile then calculates
                         the CRC value.  displays (OK!) if crc good,
                         and displays actual and "should be" values.   
 
          Notes:  Parameters listed in [ ] are optional.
                 o   Overwrites existing files without asking for
                     user confirmation.
          ================================================================  


              This section will give a detailed explanation of the command
          options used in the ST_UNZIP command.

              The command options are explained in groups determined by
          function.  The options pertaining to extracting ZIP files are
          explained first, followed by the view options, print options, and
          miscellaneous options.


          -x  Extract files from a ZIP file

              This command will extract all files from a ZIP file.  
          The extracted files will be located in the current
          directory unless you specify a destination.  The -x option
          is the default option for the ST_UNZIP command.  If no
          option is listed on the command  -x will be assumed.

              If a file being extracted already exists at the same
          destination where the extracted files are being located, the
          program will prompt you for confirmation before it overwrites the
          existing file.


          Example:   C:\DB\ST_UNZIP -x  A:lists.zip

              In the above example, all of the files will be extracted
          from the ZIP file called 'lists'. The ZIP file is located on
          the A drive,  they will be extracted to the C:\DB\ directory.

              If files in 'lists.zip' already exists at 'C:\DB\', the
          program will prompt you for confirmation before it overwrites 
          the existing file.
          ============================================================


          -xo Extracts files from ZIP file and overwrite existing files
              on disk.

              This command will extract files from a ZIP file and
          automatically overwrite any same-named files found at the
          destination where the extracted files are being located.  The
          program will NOT prompt you for confirmation before overwriting
          these files.

             The extracted files will be located in the current directory 
          unless you specify a destination.

          Example:   C:ST_UNZIP -xo zipfile 

              In the above example,  all files will be extracted
          from the ZIP file called 'zipfile' (the .zip extension is
          assumed).  As the files are being extracted any file with
          the same name in the current directory (C:) will be 
          overwritten.
          ============================================================
          

          -i  Extract an individual file from a ZIP file

              This command will extract an individual file from a ZIP   
          file.  The extracted file will be located in the current
          directory unless you specify a destination.

              If a file being extracted already exists at the same
          destination where the extracted files are being located, the
          program will prompt you for confirmation before it overwrites
          the existing file.


          Example:   C:ST_UNZIP -i zipfile stuff.exe E:\foo\

              In the above example,  the 'stuff.exe' file will be extracted
          from the ZIP file called 'zipfile' (the .zip extension is
          assumed).  The file will be extracted to the 'E:\foo\' directory.
          
              If 'stuff.exe' already exists at 'E:\foo\', the program will
          prompt you for confirmation before it overwrites the existing file.
           ============================================================


          -io Extract an individual file from ZIP file and overwrite
              any existing file with same name.

              This command will extract an individual file from a ZIP
          file and automatically overwrite any same-named file found. The
          program will NOT prompt you for confirmation before overwriting
          this file.

             The extracted file will be located in the current directory 
          unless you specify a destination.

 
          Example:   C:ST_UNZIP -xo zipfile stuff.exe

              In the above example,  the 'stuff.exe' file will be extracted
          from the ZIP file called 'zipfile' (the .zip extension is
          assumed).  As the file is being extracted any file with
          the same name in the current directory (C:)will be 
          overwritten.
          ============================================================


          -c     Extract files from a ZIP file and display them on the
                 screen

              This command will extract files from a ZIP file and display
          them on the monitor.  The extracted files will scroll
          continuously on the screen.

          
          Example:   A:ST_UNZIP  -c d:\schedule\zipfile dates.doc

              In this example, the file 'dates.doc' will be extracted from
          the 'zipfile' file in directory 'd:\schedule\' and displayed on 
          the screen and scroll continuously.

          -cm    Lists all files in ZIP file and steps through them one at
                 a time prompting for action

              This commmand will list all files, step through them, and
          prompt for (N)ext (V)iew (R)elist/(O)ne (Q)uit.

          Example:   C:ST_UNZIP  -cm e:\temp\zipfile

              The above example will list the contents of 'zipfile'.
          After the listing each file will be stepped to and a
          menu of commands  will be provided.  If you select (N)ext,
          the next file in the 'zipfile' will be the choice for action.
          If you choose to (V)iew a file, the first display will be a
          screen-full of the selected file.  You will then be prompted
          for "More:  (Y)es, (N)o, (C)ontinuous?".  Selecting
          (Y)es  will display another screen full of text.  Selecting 
          (N)o will abort the (V)iew action on the present file and 
          skip to the next file in the "zipfile".

              If the selection is (C)ontinuous, the file selected will
          scroll continuously.  You can pause the display by using
          [Control-s]:(hold the 'Control' key down and press 's'),
          to resume the display hit [Control-q].

              After the initial detailed verbose listing, the display
          defaults to an alphabetical list of filenames only.  You can
          use the (R)elist command to redisplay the detailed verbose
          listing.  You can also call up an individual file and view
          its detailed verbose information by using the (O)ne command
          selection.   Selecting (O)ne will display: (N)ext (V)iew 
          (M)ain menu.  The (N)ext command will allow you to skip
          to the particular file you wish detailed verbose information
          on.  When you get to the file name you wish to examine,
          selecting (V)iew will display detailed verbose information

              This option will display technical information concerning the
          files contained within a ZIP file.  

               The following information about each file in the ZIP file
          will be displayed (scrolled) on the screen.

                      Name        Name of the file
                      Length      Original length of the file
                      Stowage     Type of file compression used, Implode or
                                  Shrink, (or Reduce if an older version of
                                  PKZIP was used)
                      SF          Percent reduction in file size
                      Size        Size of the compressed file

          -p   Extract  a particular text file to a printer

              This option is used to extract files from a ZIP file and send
          the output to a printer.  


          Example:   C:ST_UNZIP -p zipfile.zip stuff.doc

              In the above example, the 'stuff.doc' file will be extracted
          from 'zipfile.zip' to the printer.

          -t   Tests the CRC integrity of all files in a zipfile
          
               This options reads the zipfile registered CRC value then
           calculates the files actual CRC value.  If the two values match,
           an "OK!" is displayed, if they do not match, a bell is sounded
           and an error message is displayed for the particular file with
           the error.
