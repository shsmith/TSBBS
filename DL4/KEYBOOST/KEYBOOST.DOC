KeyBoost - Keyboard booster and clicker  (S.H.Smith, 15-Aug-86)
           Public domain material.  Personal use only.

This program attaches to the keyboard interrupt.  It can improve the
responsiveness and speed of the keyboard.  It also adds a keyclick
so you can tell when the keyboard is repeating.


Usage:  KeyBoost RESPONSE SPEED CLICK

Where:  RESPONSE is A-Z   (A=no repeat, B=fastest, Z=slowest)
        SPEED    is A-Z   (A=fastest, Z=slowest)
        CLICK    is A-Z   (A=none, B=short, Z=long)

Examples:
   KeyBoost D A G         This command gives a very quick response (A),
                          fast repeats (A), and a medium keyclick (G).

   KeyBoost N B B         This command gives fast response (N), normal
                          repeats (B), and a short keyclick (B).

   KeyBoost N B A         This command gives fast response (N), normal
                          repeats (B), and no keyclick (A).

   KeyBoost V B G         This command gives normal response (V),
                          normal repeats (B), and medium keyclick (G).
