PROP - Proportional Spacing Print Utility   (01-Nov-86 shs)

This utility will print your text files with proportional spacing.
It can do so in both "draft" and two-pass "quality" modes.

To use PROP, simply enter:
   prop FILENAME
where FILENAME is the full filename of the file you want to print.

Prop can also be used to print several files at once:
   prop FILE1 FILE2 FILE3

The default action is to print each file using the default font (typeface)
file, and two-pass quality style print.   These options can be changed on
the command line.

The following options are recognized:

-Fname
   This option specifies that the font should be loaded from the file
   'name' instead of the default file, PROP.FNT.  The font file controls
   the typeface of print produced by PROP.

-Q
   This option specifies that the print should be produced in "quality"
   mode.  This mode makes two passes over each line.

-D
   This option specifies that the print should be produced in "draft"
   mode.  Each line is printed in a single pass.



Examples
   prop prop.doc
         Print prop.doc with all default values.

   prop -D prop.doc
         Print prop.doc using the faster "draft" style.

   prop -D -Fprop7.fnt prop.doc
         Print prop.doc in draft mode with a font (typeface) controlled by
         the file prop7.fnt.
