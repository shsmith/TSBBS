PKUNZIP version 0.90 does not have the ability to extract *ANY* files
from a truncated zipfile.  This utility will read the zipfile and
attempt to reconstruct the central directory so that PKUNZIP can extract
the files that are good.


Usage:  fixzip infile.zip outfile.zip

Example:
        fixzip badzip.zip fixed.zip

The input and output zipfiles must NOT be the same or your original file
will be destroyed.
