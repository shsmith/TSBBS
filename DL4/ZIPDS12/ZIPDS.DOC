This utility can be used to QUICKLY update the date/time stamp on a
bunch of Zipfiles.  It also checks for truncated or garbled ZIPs (it
does not verify the CRC, but still catches about 80% of all bad
Zipfiles.)

It will update my entire upload directory in less than a minute. When
used with 'sweep' (or similar) it can be used to globally update all
Zipfiles on your system.


Usage:  zipds *.ZIP [>OUT]

   Sets non-0 errorlevel on truncated or corrupt Zipfiles


Example:
   zipds d:\upload\*
   if errorlevel 1 goto errors


I write ZIPDS because PKZIP 0.90 cannot update zipfile timestamps
without also updating at least one member file, making it impractical to
use for batch updates.

Revision History
----------------

02-19-89 v1.0
   Initial release

03-03-89 v1.1
   Added error messages compatible with ProDoor for faulty zipfiles.
   This is required when testing zipfiles under prodoor 2.8 and 2.9 due
   to the inconsistancy of error messages generated by 'PKUNZIP -t'.

03-04-89 v1.1a
   Slight change in output format to prevent ProDoor from displaying the
   directory in which the file resides.  Changed date-stamp logic to
   prevent removing date entirely on corrupt zipfiles.

01-03-90 v1.2
   Changed logic to prevent an endless series of error messages on
   ZIP files containing AV codes.
