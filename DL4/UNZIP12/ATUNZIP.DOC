'UnZip' is a small Zipfile extract utility.   It is written to be as
small and portable as possible -- ideal as a starting point for handling
.ZIP files in non-IBM/Atari ST environments.

Source code is provided in C.  If you port this program to a 
non-IBM/Atari ST system, we would appreciate a copy of the ported 
source and exec files.


Usage
-----
desktop:
   drive:\path\filename[.zip]
   
shell:
   unzip drive:\path\filename[.zip]
   
Atari ST note: Unzip will place unzipped files into the current directory
 (usually into the folder you ran unzip from).  To run from the desktop,
 rename unzip.prg to unzip.ttp and enter zip file name into the Tos Takes
 Parameters box after clicking on unzip.ttp.  It would be best to create a
 new directory on your hard drive, or a blank floppy disk, and then copy
 unzip.ttp to it before running the program, otherwise the unziped files 
 will be mixed in with all the files in the current directory.
 When running it from a shell, you can change your current directory to a
 blank directory, and then specify the full pathname for unzip and the zip
 file on the command line (or just 'unzip drive:\path\filename[.zip] if
 your shell support directory hashing like Gulam does).
 
 If any interest is shown in the program, a gem based shell will be written
 to support unzip. 


Revision history
----------------

3-3-89 (Samuel)
   Initial alpha test release.

3-5-89 (Samuel)
   First fully operational release.  Does not implement CRC verification,
   but should correctly unzip all compression methods.

3-6-89 (Samuel)
   Corrected end-of-file detection in both shrink and reduce expanders.
   Resulting files should now always have the correct size.  Added ".ZIP"
   default to unzip.c to match calling conventions of unz.pas.

3-8-89 (Samuel)
   Moved machine and operating-system specific code to a block starting
   around line 180.  Added code to swap bytes on host machines that
   store the high order bytes in lower address locations than the low
   order bytes.

3-15-89 (Samuel)
   Added CRC checking in UNZIP.C.  Speeded operation by about 150%.

   I'm spending my time on the C version now and don't plan to do any
   further work on the pascal.  If you're using the pascal version
   please contact me.
 
3-30-89 (Darin)
   Custom 68000 assembly routine written for 32 bit CRC calculation,
   enlarged buffer support, and slight changes made to improve 
   execution speed on the Atari ST.  I'll be spending my time re-writing
   most of the time consuming routines into assembly, and making equivelent
   changes to the ST source as Samuel updates the IBM source.
