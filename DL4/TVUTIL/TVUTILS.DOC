Here are a couple of utility commands I wrote for TaskView 1.4.

SETNAME - set the name of a task, as shown by the TVSTAT command.
Usage:
   setname <partition> <name>
Example:
   setname 3 PCBoard Node 1

VSCRON - enable virtual screen mode.  This is the opposite of VSCROFF, which
is included with TaskView 1.4.  This command can be used to fight the effects 
of direct-screen writers that bleed through from the background.
