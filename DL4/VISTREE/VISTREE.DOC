                        5-Apr-86 S.H.Smith

This program will display your directory layout as a visual "tree"
structure.   VisTree does not use the "partial tree" format found
in most other programs of this kind.

This program may be freely used and copied, provided it is never
sold or otherwise used for profit.


Operation
---------

To get a visual tree listing of the current directory, simply enter:
   VISTREE

To send this to your printer:
   VISTREE >PRN

If your printer does not support the IBM line drawing graphics:
   VISTREE -G >PRN

To include all ordinary files in the tree listing:
   VISTREE -A

To include file dates in the listing:
   VISTREE -D

To list dates of newest files in listing:
   VISTREE -N

To list dates of oldest files in listing:
   VISTREE -O

You can also specify the directories to be listed:
   VISTREE C:\PROJECTS
   VISTREE B:\MYDIR C:\DATA
   VISTREE C:\ -A >PRN

Vistree will give you a brief command summary when you enter:
   VISTREE -?
