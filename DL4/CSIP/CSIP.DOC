CSIP is a very simple utility program that causes a continuous CRT
display of the processor stack and CS:IP registers.  It is useful in
debugging and tracing code that occasionally crashes or appears to
"freeze".

When CSIP is resident and enabled, the display has the following format:

        aaaa:bbbb cccc:dddd

where:
        aaaa is the current stack segment (SS register)
        bbbb is the current stack pointer (SP register)
        cccc is the current code segment (CS register)
        dddd is the current instruction pointer (IP register)


Press the SCROLL LOCK key to enable/disable the CSIP status display.

This is public domain material.

   Initial coding and release

   Added logic to determine video segment at runtime (CSIPM no longer
   needed on MONO display systems).

   Changed display to show the last 5 values of SS:SP CS:IP instead of
   only a single value.

   Added logic to check SCROLL-LOCK state and to enable the status
   display only when SCROLL-LOCK is active.
