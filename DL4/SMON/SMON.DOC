SMON - Seek Monitor

This is a small resident utility that provides a "moving seek display" that
follows the position of your disk heads as they move.   The seek monitor
display shows the active drive letter and the function code.  Function
codes are:
  R - read
  W - write
  F - format
  ? - verify
  * - other

This program isn't very useful, but it's fun to watch while waiting for 
your disk...  (it doesn't slow your disk down by more than 0.1%).

This is FREEWARE, and the source is included (of course!).   Please don't
sell this program.   If you modify it, I'd like to see the new version.
