   SourceWare: What is it?
   -----------------------
   SourceWare is my name for a unique concept in user supported 
   software. 
   
   Programs distributed under the SourceWare concept always offer
   complete source code. 

   This package can be freely distributed so long as it is not  modified
   or sold for profit.  If you find that this program is  valuable,  you
   can send me a donation for what you think it is  worth.  I suggest
   about $20.  The donation is manditory if you are using this program 
   in a comercial setting.

   Send your contributions to:

   Why SourceWare?
   ---------------
   Why do I include source code?   The value of good software should be
   self-evident.   The source code is the key to complete understanding
   of a  program.  You can read it to find out how things are done.  You
   can also change it to suit your needs, so long as you do not 
   distribute the modified version without my consent. 


   Copyright
   ---------
   If you modify this program, I would appreciate a copy of the  new
   source code.   I am holding the copyright on the source  code, so
   please don't delete my name from the program files or  from the
   documentation. 


                                 SUPPORT
                                 =======

   I work very hard to produce a software package of the highest 
   quality and functionality.  I try to look into all reported  bugs,
   and will generally fix reported problems within a few  days.  

   Since this is user supported software under the SourceWare  concept, 
   I don't expect you to contribute if you don't like it  or if it
   doesn't meet your needs. 

   If you have any questions, bugs, or suggestions, please contact  me
