                   KNOWN PROBLEMS AND PLANNED CHANGES
                   ==================================

-- Unit interface identifiers should be prefixed with unit name to prevent
   conflicts with other identical identifiers in another unit.

-- Translate "dot notation" in reference to unit interface sections.

-- Allow overloading of record member identifiers (currently entered as
   globals in the symbol table, leading to redeclarations if they are
   used in different global contexts).

-- Nested procedure variable passing.

-- Set operations (general operator overloading? - using techniques
   developed in earlier ada-tp project).

-- Selection of proper 'with' pointer when two are more with levels
   are active (may result from symbol table changes when record member
   identifiers get proper scope rules).
   
-- Return statement ordering in functions.

-- More runtime library functions.

-- Translations for binary (untyped, record types) file operations.

-- Detect and translate concat() calls.

-- Detect array-of-character data and use string-like translations.

-- Update documentation to match current program changes.

-- Write a translation guide, giving hints and tips for translating.

-- Detect and escape "%" in string expressions passed to scat, sbld, etc.

-- Work on plvalue to reduce code duplication in initial identifier parse.


-- com1..com2 range evaluates to 1 in subscript declaration (eg. wxterm)

-- udisp: datapoint[ch][rec].field[n] >> datapoint[ch][rec]->field[n]
          address of ...
          (datapoint is a pointer to an array of arrays of records)

-- unewcal: report_header[ch][line] resolves as char rather than string
-- detect integer/byte/real in val() translation
-- detect overloaded abs, sqr, random, blockread/blockwrite
