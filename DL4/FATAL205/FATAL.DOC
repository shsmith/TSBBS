Documentation?
Read the file "FATAL.ASM".
Don't like that?
Well, are you paying for this software?
((Plus a damm good example of how to write a proper TSR!))
No, des-sho?
Well then ask your Nancy Regan to read your Stars, or an all white jury!

....Waszir strikes... again   and   again  ...

So put on happy face!


-------
5th May 1992:
  FATAL /I  --> default "Re-Boot" system at TIME-OUT LIMIT
  FATAL /IB --> Re-Boot system at TIME-OUT LIMIT

Waszir's usage of this Program.

AUTOEXEC.BAT
------------
Start of Autoexec.Bat

   REM Install FATAL to RETRY on all errors
   REM FATAL to re-boot on Memory Errors
   REM FATAL to intercept Interrupts "00", "02" & "06" and re-boot
   FATAL /IRW 
   .
   .
   .
   REM End of AUTOEXEC.BAT
   REM Change FATAL parameter so that at TIME-OUT LIMIT system will RE-Boot
   REM Without this update, FATAL will RETRY errors FOREVER!
   FATAL /IBW

-------------

To recover floppy disk errors, please edit FATAL.ASM for floppy errors.
ie. Change "db '?AAAAAIA" ; 3:FD Default Actions to
           "db '?RRRRRRR" : 3:FD Default Actions.

or simply "FATAL /IR" to retry forever all non-memory errors.

Please note that timers are different between NETWORK, COMMS, Floppy and
Hard Disk errors. NETWORK is set to 1.5 seconds, whilst Hard Disk
is set to 5 seconds.

This values are clearly documented in the FATAL.ASM source code in
tables, so it is easy to customize your own.

The original program FATAL had many bugs. Many over sights and incorrect
memory handling. I've tested this program again and again. It runs fine
with WWIV 4.21 BBS software.

It also solves my problem with CONNER IDE hard disk which return the
error, "Drive NOT Ready" upon hitting a bad sector.
