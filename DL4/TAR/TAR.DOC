TAR - "Tape" ARchive:

This program will maintain a sequential access archive file that can be
used for library storage, tape storage or file transfer.
It is optimized to buffer and minimize writes to the archive
file so that slow devices will have reduced seeking.

Patterned after the unix "tar" utility.
