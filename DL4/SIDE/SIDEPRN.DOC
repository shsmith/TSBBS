Sideprn:  another sideways file printer

This program may be freely copied, provided it is never sold
or otherwise used for profit.

To print a file sideways with this program, just type:

   sideprn FILENAME

If you leave off the filename, sideprn will ask you for the name
of the file to be printed.


Note:  this program WILL print the line-drawing characters sideways!

Enjoy!     S.H.Smith, 01-Jan-85
