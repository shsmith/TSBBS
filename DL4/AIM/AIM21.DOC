Automatic Investment Management          (aim.c by David McCourt)
=================================================================

AIM  is based on the book,  "How to make $1,000,000 in the  Stock
Market"  by Robert Lichello.  It is recommended that,  before you
use this program, you obtain a copy of this book. It is available
in  paperback  (Signet # 451-E9461).  The program  establishes  a
control  amount  to  monitor the progress of each issue  in  your
portfolio.  When  the value excedes the control amount by a given
percentage, the program will recommend that you sell a portion of
the  issue.  Conversely,  when the value falls below the  control
amount,  the program recommends an amount to add to the issue. In
other words,  the program directs you to buy low - sell high. AIM
does  not  pick  stocks;  it  only monitors  the  ones  you  have
selected. The aim calculations should be done on a monthly basis.

Original Investment
===================
The  original investment is defined as the amount that you  start
with in the Automatic Investment Management Program.  This amount
is to be divided equally between stocks and a money market fund.

Re-invest Dividends
===================
When  dividends are paid,  the price will usually drop to reflect
the pay out.  Therefore,  only the price and shares are adjusted.
No changes are made to the control amount.

Additional Investments
======================
Additional    investments   are   treated   like   the   original
investment.  Divide  the  amount  in half and put one  half  into
stocks  and  the  other half into your  money  market  fund.  The
control  amount  is increased by  the amount added to  the  stock
plus an additional 10%.

Aim Sell
========
When  AIM recommends that you sell a given dollar amount,  it  is
taking  profit from your investment and placing it safely away in
your money market account to remain until the market cycles lower
and AIM tells you to buy. Control is not adjusted.

Aim Buy
========
When  AIM  recommends that you buy a  given  dollar  amount,  the
market  is  going  in to a lower cycle and you should  begin  the
accumulation phase of your investment program.  AIM will increase
you control amount by 50% of your new investment.

Note: Mutual funds may be used instead of individual stocks.





How to start
============

1. Decide on initial amount to be invested in the program.

2.  Divide  the amount equally between stocks and a money  market
fund.

3. Select stocks and funds to be used.

4.  Enter using Original purchase menu selection on main menu and
Money Market menu.

5.  Add  dividends received as stock using main menu  option.  If
dividends  are  received  as cash,  deposit in money  fund  using
interest received selection as well as any interest received from
the Money market fund.

6. Monthly update the portfolio with current prices.

7.  Buy  or  sell  as  directed by the  program  in  the  amounts
specified.

8.  The  program automatically eliminates all transactions  under
$100.  You  may  wish to set a higher limit  to  avoid  excessive
transaction  cost  or  to  comply  with  a  mutual  fund  minimum
transaction amount.
