'DOSMON' is a small resident utility that monitors DOS service activity.
It intercepts the DOS service interrupt and displays information about
dos activity on the screen.

The display format is: 
   cccc:iiiiXnn

Where
   cccc    is the caller's code segment
   iiii    is the callers IP
   X       is a rotating graphic
   nn      is the dos function number


DOSMON does not interfere with DOS functions in any way.
The overhead for DOSMON is about 3% for programs that use
a lot of DOS functions.

Direct screen writing is used to minimize overhead; some snow may be seen
on older CGA adapters.

Use at your own risk!
