PXG - The Pascal Expert Generator

By Samuel H. Smith,  Public Domain Material, Version 1.1, 6-Oct-85


This program allows you to prepare a set of rules for a
decision-tree based expert system.

You teach the expert by repeatedly "Learning" new facts in the
interactive learn mode.

When you have your rules working properly, PXG will generate a
stand-alone expert program in turbo pascal!

Legal commands while running PXG:

   New          Create a new knowledge base
                Use this to erase the current set of rules and prepare
                to create your own expert.   You will be prompted to
                enter the title of the expert.  This title will be
                included in the expert program that you generate.

   Read         Read a knowledge base from a disk file
                Use this to load in a saved knowledge base.  You
                can load either of the demonstration knowledge
                bases (LANGEXP or MECHANIC) with this option.

   Write        Write the current knowledge base to a file
                Use this to save your knowledge bases.  You can
                also edit a saved knowledge base with a text
                editor to improve the rules.

   Display      Display the rules in the current knowledge base
                Use this to get a listing of all of the current
                rules.

   Program      Generate an expert program from this knowledge base
                PXG will write a complete, ready to compile program
                in turbo pascal to implement your expert!

   Learn        Test this knowledge base and learn new rules
                Operate the expert and learn new rules.  This is
                the way you refine and build up your expert.
