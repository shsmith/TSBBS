This package provides facilities for simple screen manipulation from
Janus/ADA programs on the IBM PC.  This package is much smaller than
TEXT_IO, which would otherwise be needed for simple I/O to the screen.

Refer to the SCREENOP package specification, SCREENOP.LIB, for full
details of calling conventions.   The program SCRTEST is an example
program that tests the functions of SCREENOP.PKG.



The screen operations package provides the following functions:

Screen control
--------------
   Position cursor -  Move the cursor to a specified x/y location on
                      the screen.

   Clear screen -     Erase the entire screen and leave the cursor at
                      the home (1,1) position.

   New line -         Move the cursor down to the start of a new line,
                      scrolling the screen if needed.


Screen output
-------------
   Put character -    Put a single character to the screen.

   Put ascii -        Put a single character as specified by an
                      ascii code.

   Put string -       Put a string of characters to the screen.

   Put line -         Put a string and newline.

   Get character -    Get a single character without echo.

                      With line editing and echo.
