Version 2.1, 05-may-93

Usage:
        tm [/LOG] [/L] [/P] [START] [STOP] [REPORT] ["message"] [>outfile]

Where:
        /L              causes output to be left justified

        /P              causes a prompt for input with "message" as a prompt
                        (automatic timeout if no keyboard input in 30 seconds)

        "message"       is included in output, unless /P is used, in which
                        message is the prompt for input and any input supplied
                        is included in the output.

        /LOG            is ignored
        START           is ignored
        STOP            is ignored
        REPORT          is ignored - these are provided for compatibility
                        with norton's TM command.
