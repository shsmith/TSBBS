 Document Outline Processor:  Outline v1.5
 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     Outline is a documentation tool that will let you create and modify 
     documents in a "tree" structured way. You can use it like a word 
     processor that has the powerful ability to manipulate whole sections as 
     single lines in a higher level outline. 

     This program may be freely copied, provided it is never sold or 
     otherwise used for profit.

     1. Overview
     컴컴컴컴컴

         Outline deals with "sections" in a document. Each section has a 
         title, a 10 line description, and as many as 10 sub-sections. Each 
         sub-section is itself a section, so a document can be nested as 
         deeply as you want. If you move a section from one place to 
         another, all of the sub-sections will be moved with it! 

Document Outline Processor:  Outline v1.5                              Page 2


     2. How to enter an outline
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

         You enter your outline one section at a time. You fill in the 
         details for that section and then go down into the subsections. 

         2.1 Enter the first section
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             Type in the title for the first section. The you can fill in 
             the optional text lines. These lines will always go with the 
             title of this section. Next, list the titles of all of the 
             subsections that give details for this section. Don't worry 
             about getting it perfect; you can come back later. 

             When printed, the text lines will be reformatted to fit within 
             the printer margins. Use blank lines (with a single space) to 
             force paragraph breaks on the printout. 


         2.2 Enter the subsections
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             Now that you have the section filled in, you will want to put 
             in more details for some of the subordinate sections. You do 
             this by putting the cursor on the title of the subsection you 
             want to work on. Then press the PgDn key to go "down" into this 
             subordinate sections screen. Press PgUp to go back up. 


         2.3 Go back to the top
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             Once you have worked your way down to the lowest section of the 
             outline, just press PgUp to go back up. This works one section 
             at a time. You can go up and down by pressing PgUp and PgDn.

     3. How to print out the outline
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

         Outlines can be printed in several formats. When you press the F4 
         key, you will be given a menu of print formats. Each print format 
         is a different way of viewing your outline. 

         3.1 Print full deails
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             This print format will include all detail from your outline. It 
             will be formatted into sections, and page numbers will be 
             assigned. This is the only format that processes include files. 
             You need to run a printout in full detail format to assign page 
             numbers, if you plan to run other formats that use them. If no 
             detail printout is desired, it can be printed to the "NUL" 
             file. 

         3.2 Print outline of document

         3.3 Print a table of contents

         3.4 Print a section tree

         3.5 Print a keyword index

     4. How to move things around
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

         One of the most powerful features of an outline processor like 
         OUTLINE, is the ability to move things around by just moving the 
         titles. If you move the title of a section, all of the sub- 
         ordinate sections will automatically be moved along with it. You 
         can also copy and delete sections in this way. 

         4.1 Mark the sub-section you want to move or copy
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             The first step in doing a copy, is to locate the subsection 
             that you want to work with. Put the cursor on the subsection 
             title line and press F6. The word "<mark>" will appear to 
             remind you that the line is ready to be moved or copied. 


         4.2 Put the cursor where you want it to go
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             The next step is to move your cursor to the subsection title 
             line where you want to move TO. This can be in ANY section 
             except a subsection of the section you want to move!!! 

             To protect you from moving a section to within itself, Outline 
             will not let you go down (PgDn) into a marked section. If a 
             section were to be moved (or copied) within itself, you would 
             get an infinite self-reference! 


         4.3 And move it
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             To move the marked section to where you are, just press F7. The 
             subsection where your cursor WAS will be pushed down to make 
             room. Copy works the same way with F8, but the original marked 
             title is left alone. 


         4.4 To delete sub-sections
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             You can delete an entire section and all of the subsections in 
             it. You do this by putting the cursor on the subsection title 
             line and pressing the F9 key. The deleted section is kept in a 
             special holding area, where it can be retrieved by the F2 
             (undelete) key. 

Document Outline Processor:  Outline v1.5                              Page 5


         4.5 Oops...  Un-delete!
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             If you delete a section and change your mind, you can Un-delete 
             it with the F9 key. This will undelete, putting the recovered 
             section in front of the sub-section under the cursor. Note that 
             you can only un-delete the most recently deleted section. 


         4.6 To move a section from one outline to another
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             You can use the delete/undelete feature to move a section from 
             one outline to another. Just delete the section from the 
             original outline, retrieve a different outline, and do an 
             un-delete. Un-delete will insert the section into the new 
             outline.

     5. Summary of special keys
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

         Outline uses a number of special keys. These keys are used for 
         moving around, editing lines of text, and for getting special 
         services. 

         5.1 Keys for moving around
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             The four arrow keys can be used to move the cursor around on 
             the screen. The END key moves to the end of line. The HOME key 
             moves to the start of a line. The TAB key moves four spaces at 
             a time. The PgUp and PgDn keys let you move up and down the 
             levels of your outline. The ENTER key takes you to the next 
             line down. 


         5.2 Keys for editing lines of text
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             The BACKSPACE key moves back and deletes one character. The 
             DELETE key deletes the character under the cursor. The INSERT 
             key will insert a space under the cursor. Text that you enter 
             will overtype the line on the screen. The CTRL-X key will blank 
             out the current line. 


         5.3 Keys for special services
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             The F1 key will give you a help screen that summarizes the keys 
             that are available. The ESC key generally takes you "out" of 
             whatever you are into (the PgUp key also does this). The other 
             numbered function keys allow you to MARK(F6), MOVE(F7), 
             COPY(F8) and DELETE(F9) whole sections of your outline. You can 
             save your work at any time with the SAVE(F3) key. Do this 
             often! If you mess up, you can undo a delete with UNDELETE(F2). 
             The ESTIMATE(F10) key will allow you to assign an estimate (in 
             hours, days, etc.) to the current subsection.

         6.1 How to include text files
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             Outline will allow you to include the contents of an outside 
             text file within the description part of a section. All you 
             have to do is put in a line with the form: @FILENAME where 
             FILENAME is any legal DOS path or file name. When printing the 
             detail of this document, outline will read in this file and put 
             it in context with the proper indentation. Note that this 
             special line must not have any leading or imbedded spaces. 

             Example
             컴컴컴

                 Here is an example of an included file:

         6.2 How to include graphics files
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             Outline will allow you to include the contents of an outside 
             graphics file within the description part of a section. All you 
             have to do is put in a line with the form: &FILENAME where 
             FILENAME is any legal DOS path or file name. When printing the 
             detail of this document, outline will read in this file and 
             format it for a graphic (IBM compatible) printer. Note that 
             this special line must not have any leading or imbedded spaces. 

             Example
             컴컴컴

*** Graphics Include file not found: &EXAMPLE.GRA
                 Here is an example of an included file: 


             Graphic file format
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

                 The graphic files are required to be in a special format. 
                 This format is a sirect "binary" image of 16k of memory, 
                 starting at B800:0000.

     7. Program release history
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


         7.1 Version 1.0, 11-Jan-86
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             This was the initial release to the public domain. This first 
             version had most of the basic features, but with a primitive 
             user interface. 


         7.2 Version 1.1, 12-Jan-86
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             This release added nicer looking screens and faster displays in 
             the outline editor. The parent-section is displayed in the 
             outline editor. The file save/load/print procedures now give a 
             directory of files and allow you to pick from the directory. 
             You can include the contents of an outside text file into the 
             text of a section. The print-detail report now reformats text 
             so that the right margin is not effected by indentation. 

Document Outline Processor:  Outline v1.5                              Page 10


         7.3 Version 1.2, 16-Jan-86
         컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

             This release changes the function keys so that the editor keys 
             are much the same as the main menu keys. A startup option file 
             has been added. An outline estimate feature has been added. 

             7.3.1 Function key changes
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

                 The function keys in the outline editor were changed so 
                 that they would more closely match the main menu. 
                 F2=load/undelete, F3=save, F4=summary, F5=detail. 


             7.3.2 Startup option file
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

                 The file OUTLINE.OPT must be in the default drive when 
                 outline is started. This file controls the way outline 
                 formats reports and how it initializes the video mode. 

                 Example contents of outline.opt: 

                 {options for OUTLINE v1.2}
                 60    {max number of lines to print on a page}
                 20    {min number of lines on a page}
                 4     {spaces of indentation for each level of nesting}
                 77    {right margin for reformatted print file outputs}
                 -     {character used to underline section titles}

             7.3.3 Using outline to make estimates
             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

                 The F10 key will now assign an "estimate" to the current 
                 subsection. If used, the estimate for a section will 
                 automatically become the sum of all subsection estimates. 
                 This allows you to make estimates (in days, hours, etc.) 
                 for your lowest level details, and outline will add them 
                 all up for you.

             Added search paths for option file (outline.opt) and any 
             outline file that is being loaded. Fixed bug handling "0" 
             estimates at top level. Changed printout estimate format to 
             match the screen format. Moved printout procedures to a 
             seperate include file. Fixed a bug in text reformat that caused 
             some lines to be truncated.

             Made print file handlers remove underlining and extra blank 
             lines when no subsections are present. Removed summary from 
             beginning of detail printout. Added graphic picture include 
             files. Changed printing directory to list only *.SUM,*.PRN. 
             Added page numbers to printout and display. Changed "summary" 
             format into a "table of contents" format.

             Added "tree" format printout. Added "keyword index" format 
             printout. Added checks to see if the current document has been 
             saved or not. Fixed some bugs related to moving sections 
             around.
