Problem: Unzipping a zipfile spread across 1 or more diskettes.

  We have developed a program to breakup a zipfile over a number of
diskettes in the event that it is too large to fit onto one.
The program to do this is breakup.exe.  At the beginning of each
disk is a header giving pertinent information about the parts of the
zipfile on that particular disk.
  Our problem is in the unzipping of these diskettes.  The unzip
program developed to do this is a modified version of a unzip program
written in turbo C by Samual Smith to unpack one disk.  Our modified unzip
program unpacks each file as it comes across them and takes care of the
situation where a file has been split across disks.
  When our unzip program runs on a network it is able to completely
unzip a zipfile containing any number of compressed files.  When run
on a stand-alone, it can't create any more than 13 unpacked files.
This situation has us puzzeled.  If anyone has any suggestions, please
contact us.

INSTRUCTIONS IN THE USE OF ZIPPING AND UNZIPPING.
-------------------------------------------------

1. Breaking up a file

   Rename unzip.exe to install.exe

   Breakup.exe <filename>.zip [ L : H ]  L=low density disk
   copies install.exe to first disk.     H=high density disk

2. Unzipping file

   Install <files to look for> defaults to *.* (all)


3. compiling and linking unzip program
   There should be a .bat file called cc.bat which performs
   compilation and linking.

   cc.bat:
    tcc -B -y -mc -c -f- crc32.c
    tcc -O -Z -G -M -y -mc -f- %1 unzip crc32.obj

 4. To use unzip.c, type a:install [file series to look for, eg. 023*.wp]
    Wherever you are currently is where the files will be unpacked and
    written.  Unzip.exe (Install.exe) will only work from drive a:
