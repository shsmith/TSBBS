Smith;  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED    'UnZip' is a small Zipfile extract utility.   It is written to be assmall and portable as possible -- ideal as a starting point for handling.ZIP files in non-IBM environments.Source code is provided in C and Turbo Pascal.  If you port this programto a non-IBM system, I would appreciate a copy of the ported source andexec files.Usage-----   unzip filename[.zip]Revision history----------------3-3-89   Initial alpha test release.3-5-89   First fully operational release.  Does not implement CRC verification,   but should correctly unzip all compression methods.3-6-89   Corrected end-of-file detection in both shrink and reduce expanders.   Resulting files should now always have the correct size.  Added ".ZIP"   default to unzip.c to match calling conventions of unz.pas.3-8-89   Moved machine and operating-system specific code to a block starting   around line 180.  Added code to swap bytes on host machines that   store the high order bytes in lower address locations than the low   order bytes.3-15-89   Added CRC checking in UNZIP.C.  Speeded operation by about 150%.   I'm spending my time on the C version now and don't plan to do any   further work on the pascal.  If you're using the pascal version   please contact me.LICENSE=======You may copy and distribute this program freely, provided that:    1)   No fee is charged for such copying and distribution, and    2)   It is distributed ONLY in its original, unmodified state.If you wish to distribute a modified version of this program, you MUSTinclude the source code.If you modify this program, I would appreciate a copy of the new sourcecode.
