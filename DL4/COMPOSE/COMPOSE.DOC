Play and Playback
-----------------

These programs turn your Tandy1000 or PCjr computer into a 4 voice
electronic piano.  Play will let you play (and record) tunes at the
keyboard.  Playback will replay a previously recorded tune.

These programs require the presence of an SN76496 sound chip (not
present in an ordinary IBM PC).

(this is not the real documenatation!)
