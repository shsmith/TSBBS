Unzip Zipfile utility.

Usage:  unzip [-tcv] file[.zip] [filespec...]
 -t  test member files
 -c  output to stdout
 -a  carriage return to space conversion
     (alternatively, EBCDIC to ASCII conversion)
 -m  map extracted filenames to lowercase
 -v  view directory

Read the details in Makefile for how to compile your very own unzip.

If using Minix, try Makefile.min as the Makefile to use.

Sorry .. no Makefiles for Turbo C or Microsoft C (as of v3.0).
See the MS-DOS version (in UNZIP30.ZIP) for the .PRJ and .TC files to
use Turbo C v2.0 (interactive mode).

When testing, use the included levels.zip to test directory stripping,
filename case conversion, etc.

When testing actual extraction, be sure to use a target zip file with both
large and small members.  If you try the -a switch (CR conversion for Unix
systems unzipping MS-DOS files), expect bogus CRC errors.
