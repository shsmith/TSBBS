Please put a note in the release, telling how to contact Info-ZIP to
report bugs/improvements/additional ports.  The uucp address most
useful to Usenet people would be:  uunet!wsmr-simtel20.army.mil!info-zip

Anyone who knows about the world famous Toad Hall source of programs
will know what a sacrifice you've made.  Thanks!   :-)

(And back at Toad Hall .. that "world famous" bit is an inside joke,
guys .. we're just kidding .. really!

So .. to contact Info-ZIP for reporting bugs/improvements/additional ports:
  Usenet people via uucp:  uunet!wsmr-simtel20.army.mil!info-zip
  ARPAnet:		   Info-ZIP@wsmr-simtel20.army.mil
