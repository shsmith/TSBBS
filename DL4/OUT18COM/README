Note on OUTLINE and OUT18
-------------------------

I am placing OUTLINE, and all source code, into the public domain. 
Outline is a unique outline editor.  It has facilities for automatic 
generation of table of contents, outline graphic tree, index, summary, 
CGA-graphics, etc.   It is not at all like those other outliners that 
are in shareware or public domain.

All source code is in turbo pascal.  Some of the library files have 
TSHELL directives in them; you can either edit them or compile using 
TSHELL v1.1 or later. 

This file, OUT18COM, contains the .COM file and the rest of the source 
files.  OUT18 contains most of the source files and the documentation 
files.   On the documentation,  OUTLINE.DOC was generated by printing 
the outline file OUTLINE.OLF to disk as table of contents and detail, 
and then editing.  The .OLF file is newer than the .DOC file.  The 
documents are not fully up-to-date with the source files.  I just don't 
have time to maintain this package any more.  That's why I'm placing it 
into the public domain. 

I don't mind if you hack on this and re-release it to the public 
domain. In fact, I would like to see your improvements or 
modifications.  All I ask is that you don't try to sell it, and that 
you don't put your name on it and say that you wrote it.
