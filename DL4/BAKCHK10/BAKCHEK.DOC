This utility program scans a list of disk drives and generates a report
listing the file storage and percentage of files that have been modified
since the last backup.  It works by checking the DOS "archive" bit,
which is manipulated by most backup utilities.

Usage:
        bakchek d e f g ... [>outfile]

Sample output:
