                       NETWORK I/O MONITOR REGISTRATION

     THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FREE!  You are allowed to use NETWORK I/O MONITOR
     for a trial period of 30 days free of charge. If, after 30 days, you
     decide that you will continue using NETWORK I/O MONITOR, you must pay
     for the program by registering it with the author.  OTHERWISE YOU MUST
     DISCONTINUE USE OF THE PROGRAM.

     Each NETWORK I/O MONITOR registration is valid for use on a single CPU.
     Multi-node systems require registration for each node running NETWORK
     I/O MONITOR.

     The basic NETWORK I/O MONITOR registration cost is $5 US per CPU.  You
     will receive a printed proof of registration certificate, which entitles
     you to continue using NETWORK I/O MONITOR beyond the 30 day trial
     period.

     All orders are shipped by First Class Mail or International Air Mail.
