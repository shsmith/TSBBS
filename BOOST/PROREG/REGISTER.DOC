        Thank you for registering your copy of ProDoor!

        The new REGISTER program allows you to insert your own custom
        registration message in place of the standard "Courtesy of the
        Tool Shop" display.

        THIS PROGRAM IS FOR REGISTERED PRODOOR USERS ONLY!
        DO NOT GIVE IT TO ANYONE ELSE!

        Run this program from your ProDoor directory.



        Also, for your information:

        ProDoor and ProEdit have an undocumented feature that allows you
        to completely turn off the "* Via" taglines in new message entry.

        Add the statement
                SET NOVIA=ON
        to your PRODOOR batch or AUTOEXEC.BAT file.


        This information is not public, so please don't pass it on.


                                                    -- Sam
