        Thank you for registering your copy of ProLogon!

        The new REGLON program allows you to insert your own custom
        registration message into ProLogon.  It also converts the
        ProLogon demo into a fully functional program.

        THIS PROGRAM IS FOR REGISTERED ProLogon USERS ONLY!
        DO NOT GIVE IT TO ANYONE ELSE!

        Run this program from your ProLogon directory.
        It creates the file PROLON.REG, which must be in the current
        directory whenever PROLON.EXE is executed.
