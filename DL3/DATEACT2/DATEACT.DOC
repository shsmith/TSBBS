DATEACT is a small program that scans one or more CALLER log files, and
produces a summary of system utilization by date and day of week.  This
is useful to determine trends in system activity, and to find "peak" or
"slow" days of the week.

Usage:

        DATEACT  output_file  input_file1 ... input_file#

Where
        output_file     specifies the destination file for the generated
                        report.  Any existing file by this name will be
                        over-written.

        input_filex     The first CALLER log file to report.  Multiple
                        caller log files may be specified, and each will
                        be considered as a "node" for the calculation of
                        system utilization percentages.

Example:
   dateact c:\pcb\gen\blt22 c:\pcb\main\caller1 c:\pcb\main\caller2 c:\pcb\main\caller3

This example generates BLT22 and scans the three caller log files
specified.

   SourceWare: What is it?
   -----------------------

   SourceWare is my name for a unique concept in user supported
   software.

   Programs distributed under the SourceWare concept always include
   complete source code.

   This package can be freely distributed so long as it is not modified
   or sold for profit.  If you find that this program is valuable,  you
   can send me a donation for what you think it is worth.  I suggest
   about $10.

   Send your contributions to:
         Samuel H. Smith
         The Tool Shop
         P. O. Box 4808
         Panorama City, CA 91412-4808


   Why SourceWare?
   ---------------

   Why do I include source code?  Why isn't the donation manditory?  The
   value of good software should be self-evident. The source code is the
   key to complete understanding of a program.  You can read it to find
   out how things are done.  You can also change it to suit your needs,
   so long as you do not distribute the modified version without my
   consent.


   Copyright
   ---------

   If you modify this program, I would appreciate a copy of the new
   source code.   I am holding the copyright on the source code, so
   please don't delete my name from the program files or from the
   documentation.



DISCLAIMER
==========

I cannot be responsible for any damages resulting from the use or mis-
use of this program!




REVISION HISTORY
================
   07-Feb-94   2.1    Corrected file statements to open caller logs in shared
                      mode, to allow reporting without shutting down the board.

   16-Sep-93   2.0    Added Hourly and Weekly reports.

   20-Apr-91   1.0    Initial coding.  I wrote it because I wanted to
                      see if there was a trend in system utilization
                      on the Tool Shop bbs.

SUPPORT
=======

   I work very hard to produce a software package of the highest quality
   and functionality.  I try to look into all reported bugs, and will
   generally fix reported problems within a few days.

   Since this is user supported software under the SourceWare concept,
   I don't expect you to contribute if you don't like it or if it
   doesn't meet your needs.

   If you have any questions, bugs, or suggestions, please contact me
