 ----- TEN New SETS for PRODOOR 3.51   (two more since 3.5) ------------

  NOTE:  Upper and Lower case is NOT important BUT, the SPACING IS !!
         There is NO SPACE between the "=" signs and the values!!

         They [should] be in your BOARDx.BAT file or your AUTOEXEC
         file.  Put them where-ever you want.

  LAST:  If you are satisfied with the DEFAULTS, you DO NOT need ANY
         of them EXCEPT for the FIRST one (location of usage file).
         This can be ANY file, ANY path, but it MUST be the same for
         EACH node if you want to monitor SYSTEM usage for ALL Nodes.

  Need MORE info ??  Run the INSTALL program and VIEW the HELP files
