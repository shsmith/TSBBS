            An extension to Sam Smith's UNARCM utility

This is a fairly minor mod to Sam's UNARCM utility. Briefly, it
adds the ability to import messages from a GEnie conference into
your PCBoard message bases. I developed it to allow the Forth BBS
network (CFB-Net) to exchange messages with the GEnie Forth
RoundTable (sponsored by the Forth Interest Group). I'd suggest
you obtain permission from the appropriate conference SYSOP
before doing likewise on other GEnie conferences.

With respect to messages, GEnie has RoundTables, Categories, and
Topics. This program assumes that your capture file is from a
single RoundTable. Each Category is mapped to a PCBoard
conference. Within a conference there may be a number of Topics
-- these are used as the subject fields of PCBoard messages. All
messages are left to "ALL" (since GEnie messages don't have a
"To" field).

The only difference between this and UNARCM is in the config file
(UNARCM.CNF) CONVERT statement. Here you must associate a GEnie
category number with one of your PCBoard conferences. E.g.

     CONVERT 1, GEnie

where 1 is GEnie category #1 ("Introduction to FIG ON-line" in
the Forth RoundTable) and "GEnie" is the name of my GEnie
conference to which these messages are mapped. You must include
an entry for every GEnie category.

Please refer to the original UNARCM documentation for additional
information and license restrictions.

ImportGE expects 3 or 4 parameters:

  1. name of your configuration file (refer to the UNARCM docs
     for information).
  
  2. PCBoard directory
  
  3. Capture file
  
  4. Optional "debug" switch

For example:

  importge importge.cnf d:\pcb genie.log debug

The supplied IG.BAT file may be used if you edit it to supply the
first two parameters.

The debug switch, if enabled, causes additional information about
message processing to be displayed.

Please feel free to leave any questions or comments on the ECFB
Main conference. I also check in to Salt Air periodically.

Have fun!


Problems
--------

UNARCM normally splits long lines (more than 72 characters) into
two shorter lines of about 40 characters each, mostly on a work
boundary. ImportGE allows lines up to 80 characters in length.
This seems to work okay with PCBoard, but ProDoor will truncate
the longer lines.

The program occasionally gets confused by varying end-of-message
indicators and will sometimes jam two messages together or
perhaps write total gibberish (I got one message jam and one
gibberish in 230 messages).

GEnie messages may exceed the PCBoard limit of 100 lines,
especially when many 80 characters lines are split in two. This
program truncates messages after 100 lines.

This utility is specifically for GEnie capture files. Sam's
UNARCM would accept input from a variety of sources, but I found
that there would be too many ambiguities if GEnie were included.

No source code! See Sam Smith if you want it.
