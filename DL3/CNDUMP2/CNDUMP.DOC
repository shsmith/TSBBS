This set of utility programs will read a specially formatted 33
line/conference CNAMES file and produce a nicely formatted summary of
available conference names.  Special support is present for ProDoor
systems with multiple echo networks.

I wrote this utility for my own use when it became increasingly
difficuly to keep up-to-date summaries of available conferences on The
Tool Shop BBS.  I am placing the program into the public domain in hopes
that it will benefit other system operators.  Source code is included in
case someone wants to make program changes or to enhance this to the
point of being a 'full feature' utility instead of a hackers toolkit.


                                PROGRAMS
                                ========

CNDUMP
        This program reads the CNAMES from the current directory and
        writes a conference summary to standard-output.

CNMERGE
        This program reads the output of CNDUMP, merges fragmented
        networks into contiguous blocks, and writes a new conference
        summary to standard-output.  Use this filter when you have
        conferences scattered between different conferences.  This
        filter also sorts conferences within each network according to
        conference name.

CNFMT
        This program reads the output of either CNDUMP or CNMERGE,
        formats the listing into 4 columns, and writes the result to
        standard-output.

CNINFO
        This program is similar to CNDUMP with the addition of logic to
        report the actual message counts in each conference, and to
        track messages posted locally and those imported during net
        mailruns.

CNINFRPT
        This program formats the output of CNINFO (optionally filtered
        by CNMERGE) into a nicely formatted report of network activity.



                   SPECIAL FORMATTING IN CNAMES FILE
                   =================================

The CNDUMP program needs to know what 'network' is associated with each
conference.  Since no provision for this information is made in either
the CONFINFO or the CNAMES file, I decided to create a new file called
CNAMES.ID, which stored the network name for each conference.  The first
line corresponds to the main board, the second to conference #1, and so
on.

The CNDUMP program skips conferences that have a 'Req. security if
public' setting of 120.  These are generally not listed in the CNFN file
anyway.

The CNDUMP program normally outputs the conference number, a space, and
the conference name.  If the 'Req. security if public' setting is non-0,
the space is replaced with a '*' to indicate that the conference
requires a special security level for access.

Sorry, no time to document this any further!  Use at your own risk. This
program is FREE and includes SOURCE CODE, so make sure someone hasn't
added a bomb to my original logic!  Make backups!  Perhaps I will
enhance this program and write a proper manual for it if there is any
interest shown in it.
