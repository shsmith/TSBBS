     !WARNING! - THIS IS A DANGEROUS UTILITY!  IT'S JOB IS TO DELETE
           FILES FROM YOUR UPLOAD DIRECTORY.  USE IT WITH CARE!
                          YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.


This is a sysop utility program that will help monitor your upload 
directory and keep disk space from running out.   It can be used in your 
EVENT.SYS to automatically purge old uploads when the system must be run 
unattended for long periods. 


Usage:    ulmon KBYTES_FREE UPLOAD_LISTING UPLOAD_DIR [/batch]

Where:    KBYTES_FREE
             Specifies the number of K-bytes of free
             space to leave on the upload disk.

          UPLOAD_LISTING
             Specifies the full pathname of the file containing
             your upload directory listings.

          UPLOAD_DIR
             Is the directory where the upload files are stored.

          /batch
             Means to delete files without asking first.
             (must be lower case)


WHAT IT DOES
============

The automatic upload monitor first checks to see if the specified free 
space exists on the upload disk.  If there is plenty of space it has 
nothing to do, so it quickly exits. 

Normally, there will be enough new uploads that some of the old ones must 
be deleted to make room.   The upload monitor will scan through your 
upload files listing and check for valid filenames.   When it finds one 
it will list the file's description and ask you if it can be deleted.  If 
you say NO the file will be skipped.  If you say YES, the file will be 
deleted from the disk and from your directory listing.   This process is 
repeated until you reach the free-space goal, or run out of files. 


If you add "/batch" to the command line, the program will automatically 
delete files without asking.  This mode is suitable for use in your 
EVENT. Run the upload monitor in interactive mode first to make sure it 
works the way you want it to. 

Because this utility deletes files, I recommend that you make a full 
backup before running it the first time.   It has been carefully tested, 
but there is still a small chance of a bug and you don't want to take any 
chances. 



EXAMPLE USE IN EVENT.SYS
========================

ulmon 750c:\pcb\main\dir14 d:\upload

This command will make sure you have at least 750k of free space on drive 
D:.  It will delete files from d:\upload in the order that they are 
listed in c:\pcb\main\dir14.  It runs in interactive mode and will ask 
before killing each file. 


ulmon 2000 c:\pcb\admin\adir13 d:\junk /batch >>ulmon.log
ulmon 1000 c:\pcb\main\dir14 d:\upload /batch >>ulmon.log

This example will try to keep 2megs of free space by killing off files in 
the  d:\junk directory.   When the junk directory is empty, the upload 
monitor will start deleting files from the main upload directory to keep 
a minimum of 1meg space.   I frequently review uploads and move the 
"junk" files into the d:\junk directory, where they are still available 
for downloading until the space is needed. 

The ">>ulmon.log" command tail causes all ULMON output to be logged to 
ULMON.LOG for later reference.
