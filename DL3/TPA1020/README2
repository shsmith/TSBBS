   This archive contains a small revision of ProTpa 1.0á18 which I call
   1.0á20.  The revision corrects ProTpa's use of CDC's method of julian
   date calculation, which should solve various problems in doors that
   check expiration dates and differentiate expired conferences from
   normal conferences.
