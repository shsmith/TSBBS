  Description      :  Provide PCB14.5 USERS.SYS support for ProDoor Sysops

  Original Code    :  Max Bernard
  Non-TPA Code     :  B. H. Forbes
  Lead Beta Tester :  Thomas Enstall

  Program Usage/Syntax:

    ProTPA [tpa_keyword]  <-- Creates USERS.SYS for TPA Door.
    ProTPA /C             <-- Creates USERS.SYS for Non-TPA Doors.
    ProTPA /R             <-- Reads USERS.SYS, updates system files.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------


  What is ProTPA?
  ---------------
  If you are a ProDoor sysop who  has been wanting to  run TPA doors, or
  doors that require USERS.SYS, and did NOT like having to invoke PCB to
  do so, then this utility is for you.  It will create USERS.SYS for any
  TPA door, will read back USERS.SYS data and update EXTUSER, USERS, and
  the USERS.INF if necessary on return from the door.   In addition,  it
  can also be used with any non-TPA door that requires a USERS.SYS  file.



                        -------------------------
                        Installation Instructions
                        -------------------------

  You will need to do FIVE things:
  --------------------------------
   1)  Put ProTPA somewhere in your path where it can be found.
   2)  Revise your DOORS.LST file and set the USERS.SYS file to "N".
   3)  Revise each door bat file and add TWO lines that will call ProTPA
   4)  Revise your BOARD.BAT file and remove the call to PCB.
   5)  Revise your PRODOOR bat file and remove any USERS.SYS commands.


  Detailed Instructions:  (All VERY Important !!)
  ----------------------
  1)  You need to put ProTPA.EXE somewhere in your path so that it can
      be found when it is called.  In addition and VERY IMPORTANT, you
      MUST be in the directory where PCBOARD.DAT is when ProTPA runs
      because it needs the system file names and locations.


  2)  DOORS.LST file:
      ---------------
      Use PCBSETUP (or whatever you use now) to edit the DOORS.LST file
      and set the "USERS.SYS" field of the door to "N".   We  won't  be
      needing PCB to create this file anymore.   This is VERY important.
      If you do NOT set this value to "N", ProDoor will think that PCB
      is going to create the USERS.SYS and will NOT create the correct
      $door.bat file.

      NOTE: If you have security-specific DOORSxxx.LST files, make sure
            you edit those as well.


  3)  Door BAT files for TPA doors:
      -----------------------------
      You'll need to edit each TPA door bat file and make TWO calls to
      the ProTPA utility.  One will create the USERS.SYS file, the other
      will read the USERS.SYS file and if required, update EXTUSER, USERS
      and USERS.INF.

      Example TPA door bat file.   (TPA Door/keyword: MARKMAIL)
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      cd\pcb                             <-- Get to PCBOARD.DAT dir.
      ProTPA MARKMAIL >> ProTPA.log      <-- Creates USERS.SYS
      D:\PCB\DOORS\MARKMAIL\MARKMAIL     <-- Runs MarkMail door
      ProTPA /R       >>ProTPA.log       <-- Reads updated USERS.SYS
      IF EXIST EVENT.BAT EVENT
      BOARD


      Example NON-TPA door bat file.
      ------------------------------
      cd\pcb                             <-- Get to PCBOARD.DAT dir.
      ProTPA /C       >> ProTPA.log      <-- Creates USERS.SYS
      D:\PCB\DOORS\CHATBOX\CHATBOX       <-- Runs Chat Box door
      ProTPA /R       >>ProTPA.log       <-- Reads updated USERS.SYS
      IF EXIST EVENT.BAT EVENT
      BOARD

      NOTE:
      The '>>' redirection to a ProTPA.LOG file lets you capture all
      output from ProTPA into a log file which can be viewed later.
      Once you are comfortable that ProTPA is doing it's job, you can
      remove the ">>" redirection.


  4)  BOARD.BAT
      ---------
      Edit your BOARD.BAT file to remove any lines that now call PCB to
      process USERS.SYS doors.  Look for lines that look like this:

            IF EXIST users.sys PCB145/KEY:open;prodoor^M

      If you have a line like that in your BOARD.BAT, remove it or at
      least comment or "rem" it out (with the REM command).


  5)  PRODOOR
      -------
      Edit the bat file that calls ProDoor.  Mine is called PRODOOR,
      and is in the same directory as the rest of my doors.  Yours
      will probably be named the same, but might be in your \PCB dir.
      Look for any lines in the bat file that look like:

            IF EXIST users.sys GOTO Return145

      If you have lines like those in your PRODOOR file, remove it or at
      least comment it out (with the REM command).


  6)  Multi-node operation
      --------------------
      If you run a multi-node system and don't share the above files among
      your nodes, be sure to apply the above steps to the files used by each
      node.


  All Done!
  ---------
  You are now ready to bring the board back up.  If you followed the above
  instructions, you should now have a faster, smoother way to run doors
  that require a USERS.SYS.


  Caveats:
  --------
  This ProTPA program is a FREE TEMPORARY utility provided to you by
  the ProDoor Express (PDX) Development Team.  It is for ProDoor sysops
  that need USERS.SYS support while waiting for ProDoor 4.0.

  When ProDoor 4.0 is released, ProTPA will no longer be needed and thus,
  will cease to function.  You will be able to use the free ProTPA program
  for approximately 60 Days.

  If you decide that you do NOT want to upgrade to ProDoor 4.0 but still
  want to use ProTPA after ProDoor 4.0 is released, then you will need to
  register ProTPA.   Registration for ProTPA is $15.  You may contact

  And last... You ain't seen nothing yet !!  Watch for ANOTHER "utility".
  There are a couple of more on the way BEFORE ProDoor 4 !!

  All from the ProDoor Express (PDX) Development Team... striving to do
  better, and determined to make being a Sysop an easier/funner job.
