This program, when run in the directory containing your PCBOARD.SYS,
will read in the PCBOARD.SYS from your Prologon/Prodoor 14.2 format,
and a small .dat file SYS145.DAT, and will overwrite PCBOARD.SYS with
a new one in the PCB 14.5 format needed for some doors to operate.

This was written to use the FV (File View) program as a door off of Prodoor.
It may or may not help with your needs.

This program is freeware.

I would suggest keeping your original PCBOARD.SYS in tact, so I use
the batch file to do this:

copy PCBOARD.SYS PCBOARD.BAK
SYS145
cd\doorsdir
doorprg
cd\pcb
del PCBOARD.SYS
ren PCBOARD.BAK PCBOARD.SYS
board
