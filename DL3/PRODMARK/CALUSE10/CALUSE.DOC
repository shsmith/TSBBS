Caluse 0.9 beta

By Greg Grimshaw   Copyright 1992 - Grimware

	I will make one statment before continuing, Pcboard 14.5
is a commercial program. Commercial software requires that the 
user (sysop) have made ALL legal payments before attempting to use
this software. I will not be held responcible for people who violate 
these requirements. ProLogon and ProDoor are copyright of Sam Smith and
require user to make a payment for use beyond a resonable trial period.
I do not intend to slander the name of Clark Developement with this
document and any statements impling this are not intentional. I hope 
that Clark Developement will reverse their present opinion and
support open developement of good quality Third Party Applications(TPA).
We have already lost the creative genious of Sam Smith, I hope
we do not discorage others.

This program has been created for LEGAL ProLogon BBS SYSOP
who have been screwed by closed minded authors of PCBoard.
These people feel that they can dictate to sysops and indirectly
the people we support, the user, that they have such a special BBS
package they are willing to reduce the software created for this 
program by creating special file formats that can not be viewed 
without authors signing a non-disclosure agreement. Although
I created Caluse for Mail doors like Markmail, other doors that
require from the user.sys file will benifit as well.

	As any ProLogon sysop knows, you require PCB to operate
correctly. As a ProLogon Sysop you have made a desision will
not serve your users purposes as you wish. This does not mean 
you should not be able to operate the software you have paid for.
Caluse accesses PCB in a way that is transparent to your users. They 
will not have to enter PCB just to run a TPA. 

 Syntax:
Caluse C:\BBS\

	The command line is the pointer to the PCBoard.sys and must
have the path only. I have Caluse in my utility directory but it may be 
anywere in your path. 
Typical batch file:

@echo off 
echo calling Qmail
cd\pcb
Set TPA=MM
caluse C:\BBS\
D:\MM\MarkMail
set TPA=
cd\bbs
board


	You will note that there is a call to name a DOS environment
TPA to the name of the TPA predefined in PCBSETUP. After you call
Caluse, User.sys will be present to the TPA to use. You must have
sufficent DOS memory to add this variable.

Some of the features of Caluse is the one call of the file to obtain
the file. If Caluse discovers an error in operation, it will record 
the error to a file called Caluse.err, it will contain the date, time
and nature of the error. If no path is found in the command line, Caluse
will assume the file is present in the operating directory.

Typical contents of Caluse.err
C:\BBS>type caluse.err
05-30-1992    13:38:03      No TPA installed in DOS
C:\BBS>
