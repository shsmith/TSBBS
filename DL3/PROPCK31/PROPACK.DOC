    ProPack is designed to make it quick and easy to keep your PCBoard v14
    compatible conference files in top condition.  It is an indispensable
    utility for systems with many large conferences or "net mail" between
    boards.

    Some of the high points of ProPack include:

          *    Fast!  Runs 5 to 10 times faster than standard util-
               ities.  Uses assembly language and advanced buffering.

          *    Detect and automatically delete duplicate messages.

          *    Eliminate multiple network "taglines" to reduce message
               base chaos.

          *    Option to remove reader "Via" line advertisement lines.

          *    Option to remove IBM and "high-ascii" codes.

          *    Option to automatically delete .BAK file after process-
               ing is successfully completed.

          *    Purge messages after they reach a specified age.

          *    Automatically limit conference size to a specified
               number of active messages.

    ProPack is NOT public domain software.  You may use, copy and distribute
    it freely, but you MAY NOT RESELL ProPack.  A modest fee for copying may
    be charged, not to exceed $3.00 exclusive of the cost of disk, mailer
    and postage.

    If you like and use ProPack, I request you register the program after a
    reasonable trial period (about 30-45 days).

    ProPack is very small and lightning fast.  It is the fastest way I know
    of to pack and re-index PCBoard message files.  It can pack a conference
    with 1000 messages in less than a minute.  The standard PCBPACK program
    takes many minutes and much disk thrashing to do the same thing.


    High speed operation is achieved through advanced buffering techniques
    and optimized assembly language in critical sections.  

    Speed is not gained through "cutting corners" or lax error checking.  

    ProPack contains extensive error checking and makes every effort to
    preserve all available data -- even when the message base is already
    partially corrupt.


    ProPack will remove all "killed" messages, and will skip over older 
    ones to keep the specified number of messages on file.


    ProPack has the ability to detect and remove "duplicate" messages. This
    option will remove any message that exactly duplicates the text, has the
    same subject, and is from the same person as any other message.  

    This is very useful in conjunction with Qnet, Qmail, and other PCBoard
    echo/message extensions.  A very fast 32-bit CRC is used to locate the
    duplicates.


    You can use batch files with ProPack.  Since you specify the full message
    base filename on the command line, it will easily handle your "external"
    conferences.


    ProPack can handle message bases with as many as 15000 messages.   
    Please limit your "message blocks" to 15 or less when you define   
    conferences.


    ProPack is fully integrated with the ProDoor system.  You can use
    ProDoor's PROSM utility to automatically generate a batch file for event
    processing using ProPack.


    You can redirect the output of ProPack to generate a summary log file
    that records status messages for unattended operation.


    ProPack has the ability to capture the text of purged messages into
    a text file for archival purposes.


                                      USAGE
                                      =====

      ProPack  MAILFILE MAXMSGS [/DEHKLRTUVX] [/Nxxx] [/Sfile]


                                   PARAMETERS
                                   ----------

     MAILFILE  Mail file d:\path\name to be packed.

     MAXMSGS   Maximum number of messages to keep, 0=no limit.


                                     OPTIONS
                                     -------

    Options can be combined without additional "/" or space characters.

     /D   Kill any message that has the same exact text, subject and from-
          user as a previous message.

     /E   Exclude tag-lines and via-lines when checking for duplicate
          messages.

     /H   Reset "high message number" to last message number.

          Warning: use of this option can lead to the high message number
          being re-assigned to a different message, causing messages to be
          "lost" under some netmail or reader software.

     /I   Remove IBM and "high-ascii" codes.  This option changes all ascii
          codes greater than chr(127) to ".".

     /K   Kill .BAK file after a successful pack.
     
     /L   List duplicate message numbers as they are killed.

     /Nxx Kill messages over xxx days old.

     /R   Purge RECEIVED+PRIVATE messages.

     /T   Removes all but the first '* Origin' tagline generated by Qnet,
          PCRelay, or other netmail systems.

     /Sfn Capture purged message texts into the text file 'fn'.  If this
          file already exists, the text will be appended.  Otherwise a
          new file will be created.

     /U   Always keep UN-RECEIVED+ PRIVATE messages regardless of other
          options.  Keep any message that is PRIVATE but has not been
          received, even if it is old and would normally be purged.

     /V   Remove '* Via' lines generated by alternate readers such as
          ProDoor, Qmail, EZ-rdr, RelayMail, etc.

     /W   Preserve the two-line format in "PCRelay:" taglines. The default
          (when /T is used) is to keep only the first of  the two lines.

     /X   List message texts during packing.  The listing may  include line
          markers for the "Tear", "Via" and "Tag" line components of a
          message.  This display is used in debugging to help locate the
          reason for message duplication.




                                    EXAMPLES
                                    ========

    ProPack c:\pcb\main\msgs 1000

          Pack the main board, leaving no more than 1000 active messages.


    ProPack \pcb\tools\tools 500 /D /L

          Pack the "tools" conference, deleting all duplicates and leaving no
          more than 500 active messages.


    ProPack \pcb\sysops\sysops 14000 /D /R

          Pack the "sysops" conference, deleting all duplicates, all
          RECEIVED+PRIVATE messages, and leaving no more than 14000 active
          messages.


    ProPack \pcb\ibm\ibm 500 /DLN180T

          Pack the "IBM" conference, deleting and listing all duplicates,
          leaving no more than 500 active messages, deleting messages over
          180 days old, and removing multiple "origin" tag lines.  Notice
          that options can be combined without extra "/" characters or
          spaces.


    ProPack \pcb\ibm\ibm 100 /DLN180T /S\pcb\ibm\ibm.sav

          Pack the "IBM" conference, as in the previous example, but
          will also save the text of the purged messages in the file
                \pcb\ibm\ibm.sav
          for archival purposes.

                                 ERROR MESSAGES
                                 ==============

    Error: Missing command line parameters

          You must always specify the conference file to be packed and the
          maximum number of messages to store in the conference.  If you
          leave off either of these parameters you will get this error
          message along with a summary of the command format and options.


    Error: Invalid digit in "MAXMSGS" parameter

          Following the conference file name you must always specify the
          maximum number of messages to store in the conference.  This error
          usually indicates that you forgot to include the number of messages
          and instead entered one of the command options.


    Error: Unknown option: ____

          This error means that you are using a command line option that is
          not recognized by the program.


    Error: Cant open index file

          ProPack requires that an index file be present for each message
          file being packed.  If you are creating a new conference, or if you
          have lost your index file, please use ProDoor's PROSM program to
          create a new one.


    Error: Cant open message file
     
          Please check that you are specifying the proper full path and file
          name for the conference you with to pack.  This error might also
          indicate that the message file is in use by another program that
          requires exclusive access to the same file.  Network systems should
          insure that all nodes are offline before attempting to pack a
          conference file.


    ProPack Aborted.  Reason: Could not rename _________ to ________

          After packing is completed, ProPack attempts to rename the original
          message file to 'name.BAK', and then to rename the newly packed
          file to 'name'.  Rename failure usually indicates that the original
          file is in use by another program.  Network systems should insure
          that all nodes are offline before attempting to pack a conference
          file.








    ProPack Aborted.  Reason: Write failure - disk full or bad sector

          This error is reported when DOS reports an error while writing to
          the new conference file.  It usually indicates that the disk is
          too full to hold the original message file plus the new file, or
          that there is a bad sector that prevented the file from being
          written.  


    ProPack Aborted.  Reason: Index too large - decrease index blocks

          Index files should be 64k or smaller.  ProPack loads the entire
          index into memory for the fastest operation possible.  If you are
          using very large index files you need to reduce them to 15 or
          fewer blocks using ProDoor's PROSM utility.


    ProPack Aborted.  Reason: Index file overflow - increase index blocks

          Each index file must be allocated large enough to have one entry
          for each message number between the lowest message and the highest
          message in a conference.  Index file sizes are *NOT* based on the
          number of active messages - rather the size is based on the size of
          the range of valid message numbers.  


    ProPack Aborted.  Reason: CRC table overflow - delete .CRC file and rerun

          This error indicates that the .CRC file used for duplicate message
          detection has grown beyond the limits of the program.  ProPack
          allocates room for 15000 total messages in the CRC file.  After
          processing this many messages you may have to manually delete the
          'name.CRC' file and let ProPack rebuild it from scratch.

     Please note that it is normal for ProPack to leave a .CRC file in the
     same directory as the message file.  This small file contains informa-
     tion on present and past messages that makes it possibly to quickly
     determine if a new message is unique or a duplicate.  

     If you delete the .CRC file it will slow down program operation because
     it must then look at each and every message to check for duplication.



                                  ERROR LEVELS
                                  ============

    ProPack returns with ERRORLEVEL set to 0 after a successful pack.  If any
    error occurred during the pack ERRORLEVEL will be set to 1.
