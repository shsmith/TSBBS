    This program will analyze the PCBoard DOWNLOAD.TXT log file, and produce
    a summary of the number of times each available file has been downloaded.
    Each time this program is run, execution is speeded by processing only
    the lines added to DOWNLOAD.TXT since the prior execution.

    This program can be used in conjunction with TRIMDL to keep accurate
    download counts, even when the DOWNLOAD.TXT file is trimmed to reduce
    file size.  Remember to reset file counters by erasing the DLCOUNT.DAT
    file each time you use TRIMDL or any other utility to trim the
    DOWNLOAD.TXT file.


                                     USAGE
                                     =====

    dlcount DOWNLOAD.TXT DLPATH.LST DIRFILE ... DIRFILE

    The first parameter specifies the full directory and filename of your
    DOWNLOAD.TXT file.  This is usually C:\PCB\MAIN\DOWNLOAD.TXT.

    The second parameter specifies the full directory and filename of your
    DLPATH.LST file.

    You may then specify any number of DIR files to be updated. Wildcards are
    allowed.  Each specified DIR file will be updated to reflect the current
    download count for all listed files.


                                    EXAMPLE
                                    =======

    c:
    cd \pcb\gen
    dlcount c:\pcb\main\download.txt dlpath.lst dir* upload

    This sample command is suitable for use in your EVENT.SYS file to
    automatically update all DIR* listing files and the UPLOAD listing file.

                                ================

    15-Feb-94 version 1.2
       Changes to allow processing of more files in less available ram.

       Added logic to allow wildcards outside the current directory.

       Sometimes the 'last download' dates in december are reported as 00

              OR REPORTED DATES WILL NOT BE CORRECT!
