:+
:-
(+) or (-)  You can change the "default" reading direction by typing "+"
            or "-".  The prompt tells you which way you are going. 
            Pressing (Enter) alone advances in the current direction and
            displays the next message available. 
~~
:#
(#)         You can type any message number and that message will be 
            displayed. If there is no such message number on file, 
            ProDOOR will search for the closest message and display that
            one instead. 
~~
:/
(/)         Redisplay the current message.
~~
:A
(A)bandon   Leave current conference and return to the Main Board.
            Continue reading messages.
~~
:C
(C)omment   Enter a comment message to the sysop.  You specify the
            'subject' of the message.  The message will be protected so
            it is seen only by the sysop.
~~
:E
(E)nter     Enter a new message.  You then specify who the message is to
            be addressed to, as well as the 'subject' of the message.
            You can protect the message so it will be seen only be the
            'receiver'.
~~
:ENTER
(Enter)     Search for the next message.  Notice the prompt message 
            "(Enter)='+'" or "(Enter)='-'" to tell which direction 
            (Enter) will take you. 
~~
:G
(G)oodbye   Logs you off the system.  Examples:

            need to type RETURN to activate most commands.
