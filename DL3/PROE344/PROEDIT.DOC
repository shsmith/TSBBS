   ProEdit is a full feature message utility for PCBoard sysops.  It
   allows you to read, reply-to and enter messages without logging into
   PCBoard.

   It is compatible with network systems and allows most sysop mail
   functions from a TaskView or DoubleDOS partition while PCBoard is
   running.


   ProEdit is a "local only" version of PCB/ProDoor.  It reads your
   PCBOARD.DAT file to find your conferences, sysop function keys, etc.
   It enables the F5 key for dropping to DOS in the middle of a session.

   ProEdit also allows you to MODIFY existing messages;  you can change
   the message header as well as the text.

   ProEdit implements ProDoor's "Zip scan" mode, allowing you to select
   messages based on a keyword somewhere in the text.

   ProEdit provides most of the familiar PCBoard commands, and should
   not require any explanation to experienced PCBoard operators.

   Your CNFN (or CNFNG) file is used as a conference selection menu,
   allowing you to switch conferences while inside ProEdit. You can also
   specify the conference to edit on the command line.

   ProEdit looks in the current directory for these files:
      PROMAIL           ;read-mail help message
      PROENTR           ;message entry help message
      PROVIS            ;visual editor help message
   These files will be used if present, but are not required for proper
   operation.

   ProEdit is compatible with ProDoor's extended conference system.
   Make sure you always run ProEdit from your ProDoor directory.

   If you do not use ProDoor, you should delete the 'CONFINFO' file
   after making any change in your CNAMES (conference information) data
   through PCBoard.

   Usage
   -----

   proedit [SYSTEM_DIR] [OPTIONS] [INITIAL_CONFERENCE] [INITIAL_COMMANDS]

   SYSTEM_DIR specifies the location of your PCBOARD.DAT file.

   OPTIONS, if present, may be any of:
       -N###            ;select user record number ###.  The default
                         user record is #1 (sysop).

       -R               ;do not flag messages as being "read"

       -U               ;do not update message pointers

       -Q               ;quickly jump to the last message available
                         instead of where you left off before.

       -C               ;enable user CITY display

       -X               ;expand macros in message text

       -R -U -Q         ;all three options

   Note that all options begin with "-".  All options must be separated
   with spaces.


   INITIAL_CONFERENCE specifies the conference to join on entry
   to the message base.  If no initial conference number is given, you
   will be sent to the one you were in last time you were in the system.

   INITIAL_COMMANDS can be any list of ProEdit commands, to be executed
   after joining the conference.


   Examples
   --------

   proedit c:\pcb
           ReJoin the conference you were reading in your previous
           session and begin reading the new messages.  All pointers
           will be updated as if you were logged into the system.

   proedit c:\pcb -n2
           Access proedit using the SECOND user record instead of the
           first one.  This allows you to access alternate user names
           through ProEdit.

   proedit c:\pcb j 4
           Join conference 4 and begin reading the new messages. All
           pointers will be updated as if you were logged into the
           system.

   proedit c:\pcb -R -U -Q j 4
           Join conference 4 and quickly jump to the last message,
           bypassing the conference news and last-read pointers.

     SourceWare: What is it?

     SourceWare is my name for a unique concept in user supported
     software. Programs distributed under the SourceWare concept always
     offer source code.

     This package can be freely distributed so long as it is not
     modified or sold for profit.  If you find that this program is
     valuable,  you can send me a donation for what you think it is
     worth.  I suggest about $20.

     Send your registrations to:
                   Samuel H. Smith
                   The Tool Shop
                   P. O. Box 4808
                   Panorama City, CA 91412-4808

     When you send a registration, your existing user account on The
     Tool Shop will be upgraded for extended time and downloading.  You
     will also be able to download a special "register" program.  The
     register program allows you to install your own "registration"
     message seen by callers when opening ProDoor.


     Why SourceWare?

     Why do I include source code?  Why isn't the donation mandatory?
     The value of good software should be self-evident.  The source code
     is the key to complete understanding of a program.  You can read it
     to find out how things are done.  You can also change it to suit
     your needs, so long as you do not distribute the modified version
     without my consent.


     Copyright

     If you modify this program, I would appreciate a copy of the new
     source code.   I am holding the copyright on the source code, so
     please don't delete my name from the program files or from the
     documentation.

          I make no warranty of any kind, express or implied, including
          without limitation, any warranties of merchantability and/or
          fitness for a particular purpose.  I shall not be liable for
          any damages, whether direct, indirect, special or
          consequential arising from a failure of this program to
          operate in the manner desired by the user.  I shall not be
          liable for any damage to data or property which may be caused
          directly or indirectly by the use of this program.

          IN NO EVENT WILL I BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING
          ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS OR OTHER INCIDENTAL OR
          CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO
          USE THE PROGRAM, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.


                                       SUPPORT

     I work very hard to produce a software package of the highest
     quality and functionality.  I try to look into all reported bugs,
     and will generally fix reported problems within a few days.

     Since this is user supported software under the SourceWare concept,
     I don't expect you to register if you don't like it or if it
     doesn't meet your needs.

     If you have any questions, bugs, or suggestions, please contact me at:
                        The Tool Shop BBS
