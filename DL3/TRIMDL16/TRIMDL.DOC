This program is used to limit the growth of the PCBoard DOWNLOAD.TXT log
file.  Unattended, this file will grow to be extremely large.

This utility compresses your DOWNLOAD.TXT file by "trimming" out
multiple download entries for the same file.  It also removes listings
for files that have been deleted from the system and reports files that
have never been downloaded.

Usage:  cd \pcb\main
        trimdl trimdl.cnf
        del download.bak
        ren download.txt download.bak
        ren download.new download.txt

The file TRIMDL.CNF must list your upload and all download directories.
You can use your DLPATH.LST file as-is in place of TRIMDL.CNF.  If a
file is found that does not exist in any of these directories it will be
purged from the DOWNLOAD.NEW file which is created.


  
SAMPLE OUTPUT
=============

The 'UNPOP' report lists files that have been uploaded but never
downloaded.  When sorted by date, this file can act as a guide in
deciding which files to purge.

REVISION HISTORY
================

10-May-87 version 1.0
   Initial coding (not released to public)

19-Sep-88 version 1.1
   Initial public release.  Recoded internal data structure as a
   tree to speed operation, added UNPOP and DUPS reports.

17-Mar-89 version 1.2
   Added a config file that lists download directories, and the ability
   to remove obsolete information for files that no longer exist.

24-Apr-91 version 1.3
   Removed DUPS report and tracking of multiple uploads on the same
   filename.  Changed internal data structures for better utilization of
   memory to allow trimming of much larger DOWNLOAD.TXT files than
   before.  Hashing is now used internally to speed up filename
   matching.

11-Jul-92 version 1.4
   More tweaking to allow still larger download.txt files to be
   processed.

02-Feb-04 version 1.5
   Compiled in protected mode to allow much greater download.txt sizes
   and up to 100000 different files.  Needs a VCPI provider to run
   (works nicely in a dos session under Windows 3.1).
