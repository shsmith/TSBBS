Release notes for ProDoor 3.42                          07-13-91
==============================

ProDoor 3.42 is a minor release fixing known bugs in ProDoor 3.41.

This version does not include a new manual, and does not require and
data or configuration file changes compared to prodoor 3.41.

Please read !PRODOOR.NEW for details on exactly what's been changed.


Installation
------------

Install PRODOR34.ZIP as instructed in the enclosed documentation.

Then replace the PRODOOR.EXE file with the new one provided in PROD342.ZIP.

All file formats of ProDoor 3.4 are still recognized; no file
conversions or changes are required.

If you are using the RECYCLE (stacked door) utility, you will now need
to upgrade to RECYCLE3.ZIP.

If you are hooking into fidonets, there is a new environment variable:
     SET NOTEAR=ON
to prevent prodoor from inserting the "---" tearline before the message
tagline.

Additional changes are required in your PRODOOR doorfile for operation
with doors using DOORS.SYS or USERS.SYS files.  Use the provided
PRODOOR.INS and PRODOOR files.

The correction involves the replacement of
   rem call up pcb145 on return from new style doors
   if exist users.sys pcb145/key:open;prodoor^M
   if exist door.sys pcb145/key:open;prodoor^M

with
   rem call up pcb145 on return from new style doors
   if exist users.sys goto return145
   if exist door.sys goto return145

and the addition of
   :return145
   echo  >$door.bat pcb145/key:open;prodoor^M
   echo >>$door.bat door
   $door

to the end of the PRODOOR doorfile.


Optional Files
--------------

The overlay version of ProDoor 3.42 is posted as PROD342O.ZIP.
