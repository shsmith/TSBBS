`Recycle' is a utility that will allow you to 'stack doors' from within
ProDoor.   When you exit a door that was opened from ProDoor, control
will be returned to ProDoor instead of the main board.  This utility
also properly handles doors with built-in (G)oodbye handlers.

Place a copy of RECYCLE.EXE in a DOS subdirectory, or in your PCBoard
system directory.  It will be called before each PCBOARD.EXE load.

Modify your BOARD.BAT file as shown:

   if exist event.bat rename event.bat event.sys
   if exist remote.bat rename remote.bat remote.sys
   if exist door.bat del door.bat
   if exist endpcb del endpcb
   
   recycle >NUL                         <-- add this
   if errorlevel 2 goto logoff
   if errorlevel 1 goto runpcb          <-- add this
   copy prodoor door.bat >nul           <-- add this
   door N                               <-- add this
   :logoff
   if exist sofar.bat call sofar
   :runpcb                              <-- add this
   if exist $door.bat del $door.bat     <-- add this (NOTICE!)
   pcboard
   
   if exist door.bat door
   if exist remote.bat remote
   if exist event.bat event
   if exist endpcb goto end
   board
   :end
