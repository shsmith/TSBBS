GETCSPEED - Get connect speed from PCBOARD.SYS
Copyright 1991 Samuel H. Smith; all rights reserved.

This utility program reads PCBOARD.SYS in the current directory and
exits with ERRORLEVEL set to the connect speed.  You can then use the
standard IF ERRORLEVEL statements to branch according to the caller's
current connect speed.
