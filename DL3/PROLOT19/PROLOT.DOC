ProLot - Another DOOR for "ProKit"
----------------------------------

This door program implements a real lottery for your users.  

Each ticket costs a minute.  Losing tickets are thrown into the pot. 
Winners are credited with most of the time in the jackpot.  

The sysop can control the amount of "cream" taken off the top... 
resulting in a total reduction in online time. 

Here is a sample configuration file:

   HANDSHAKE
   c:\pcb\gen\blt12
   68.0
   1549
   0.10
   100
   The last winner was SYSOP, who won 80 minutes on 02-04-88 17:51.
   c:\pcb\gen\blt13

   --------------------------
   Configuration file format:

   line 1 = Driver type (HANDSHAKE, INTERRUPT, BIOS, PCBTRAP)
   line 2 = Lottery status bulletin filename
   line 3 = Number of minutes currently in the pot
   line 4 = Number of tickets sold so far
   line 5 = Fraction of time taken aside for sysop
   line 6 = Odds against winning (higher numbers give higher jackpots)
   line 7 = Information about the last winner
   line 8 = Lottery winner history bulletin filename


The lottery generates a bulletin each time it is run.  You can post this 
bulletin to let your users know how big the jackpot is (which should 
encourage them to buy more tickets).
