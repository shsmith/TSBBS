ProBank - Another DOOR for "ProKit"
-----------------------------------

This door program implements a real Savings Bank for your users.

Your users can deposit time in a personal "account" and then withdraw
the time on a later date when they need it.  This will allow users to
"save up" time for that big download they can't otherwise get.

The sysop can limit the maximum "balance" or time savings to prevent
someone from hogging the system for too long.

Revision history
----------------

04-17-90 v1.7 beta
        Recompiled with ProKit 3.2 beta libraries.  This version
        supports non-standard COM ports through COM8 as well as the
        COMBASE and COMIRQ environment variables.
