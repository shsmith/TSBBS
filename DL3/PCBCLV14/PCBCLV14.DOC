CLVIEW is a simple utility to allow PCBoard sysops to quickly scan 
through the caller log file.   You can page forward and backward 
or jump to a specified record number.   A filter option eliminates 
all lines except logons, messages and file transfers.   DOS 3.x 
file sharing is supported. 

Full source code is provided, of course...

If you like this program, please call my system and leave me a 
note. I would also appreciate bug reports and suggestions for 
improvements. 

Enjoy!
