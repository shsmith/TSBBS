ProDOOR Library function                                
------------------------

ProDOOR now supports a 'lib' command for access to a CD-ROM library disk.
The INSTALL program will do most of the installation for you.


To install this feature you need these additional files:

\pcb\prod\LIBDEF
   -- library disk definition file.  this file lists the cd-rom
      directory prefix for each range of disk codes.

   example:
      9 \1-100\disk00
      99 \1-100\disk0
      100 \1-100\disk
      200 \101-200\disk
      300 \201-300\disk
      400 \302-400\disk
      500 \401-500\disk
      600 \501-600\disk
      700 \601-700\disk
      800 \701-800\disk
      900 \801-900\disk


\pcb\prod\PROLIB or PROLIBg
   -- menu of library disks.  you can either list all library disks
      here, or make this short and put the library disk table
      into a DIR file.

  example:
         Library disks available on CD-ROM:
         Disk                Description
         ----  ------------------------------------------
         0001  Game Series No 1
         0002  Spoolers
         0003  RATBAS
         0004  DBMS/Modem7
         0005  PC-FILE Plus Disk 1 of 2


\pcb\prod\proclib.bat
   -- this batch file is called by prodoor to process each library
      request.  it is called with the first parameter specifying the
      arc file to create, and the second parameter giving the directory
      as listed in the LIBDEF file.   you can edit this file to call
      up PKARC, ARCA, ARC520, etc. to physically access the CD-ROM.

   example:
      rem. process library disk request - for ProDOOR 2.5 beta 31
      proctree E:%3 xcopy >C:\PRO\arctree.bat
      command/c C:\PRO\arctree nul
      C:
      cd C:\ARC
      if exist CD-DISK.ARC del CD-DISK.ARC
      arca CD-DISK.ARC {playdir}\*.* >%1 /d
      echo. >>%1
      echo Thank you for waiting! >>%1
      echo Disk %4 is now stored in CD-DISK.ARC for you! >>%1
      echo. >>%1


\pcb\prod\PROTREE.EXE
   -- this is a utility called by proclib.bat to scan for subdirectories
      on the CD-ROM and produce a command sequence to process them.


\pcb\prod\LIBHELP or LIBHELPg
   -- this help message is printed just before proclib.bat is called.  it
      should explain to the user where to look for the cd-rom library
      files.  the default file says to look in 'scratch.arc', but you can
      change proclib.bat and this message file to use any other filename.


The library function can be called up from the prodoor main command
prompt by typing 'LIB' (for LIBrary disk).
