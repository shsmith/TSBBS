                     BEEPER - Resident BEEP Handler

          Copyright 1992 Samuel H. Smith; All rights reserved.

  This FREEWARE package can be freely distributed so long as it is not
  modified or sold for profit.

  This program is a TSR that traps bios BEEP signals and converts them
  background beeps with a command-line controlled frequency.  This
  useful if your machine's BIOS gives you a tiresome slow beep, or if
  you have multiple machines and would like each to have its own
  distinctive beep tone.

  Usage:
        BEEPER n

  where
        n       indicates the beep tone and may be a number between 0
                and 9.

  Examples:
        BEEPER 1
        BEEPER %PCBNODE%

                            Revision History

  12-12-92
     Initial release as BEEPER10.ZIP.

  02-16-93
     Added logic to limit the number of pending beeps to 10, which helps
     in cases where a BBS can quickly generate dozens of beeps due to
     line noise of user input.
     Released as BEEPER11.ZIP.
