This program is used to limit the growth of the PCBoard caller log file.
Unattended, this file will grow to be extremely large.   It will remove all
log entries that are older than a given number of days.   When run as an 
EVENT, it can automatically limit the caller log to, say, the last 3 weeks.


Usage:  trimlog DAYS INFILE OUTFILE

DAYS    is the number of days of log data to retain
INFILE  is the input file, usually /pcb/main/caller
OUTFILE is the new file to write, cannot be the same as INFILE



Example usage in EVENT.SYS

    trimlog 21 \pcb\main\caller \pcb\main\caller.tmp
    if errorlevel 1 goto no_disk_space
    del \pcb\main\caller
    ren \pcb\main\caller.tmp caller
    :no_disk_space

This sequence will trim the caller log to the last 3 weeks (21 days) and
will replace the caller log only if nothing goes wrong.
