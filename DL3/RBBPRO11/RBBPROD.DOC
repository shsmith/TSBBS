INSTALLATION
============

1. Place the files in this ARC in \PROD.  If you want to put them 
   somewhere else, you must edit PROD25.CNF, PROD.BAT and 
   PCBOARD.DAT. 

2. Copy the <FILES.BBS files from each of your public file areas> 
   to files DIR1, DIR2, etc. in \PROD.  These are the files used 
   by prodoor for the [F]ile listings, [Z]keyword search and 
   [L]ocate files functions.  You might want to schedule an event 
   to automatically update these from time to time.  Edit 
   PCBOARD.DAT to list the pathnames to your download directories 
   and your upload directory. 

3. Edit DIR to list the file areas avaiable by number to correspond 
   to the DIRn files.  

4. (optional) create a bulletin menu file BLT and any number of 
   bulletin text files BLT1, BLT2, etc.  Edit PCBOARD.DAT to list 
   the number of active bulletins. 

5. Rename PROD.BAT to the desired door number for ProDOOR in your 
   RBBS system.  Edit your <doors menu> file to list this door. 
   
6. Security measures.  Prodoor has a full set of user-level based 
   security features.  Security levels for the various menu 
   options are defined in PCBOARD.DAT.   Security levels for 
   download directories are defined in FSEC.   The prodoor gateway 
   does not update any RBBS files to record user activity (it 
   does, however, keep a detailed activity log in PCBOARD format 
   as well as an optional transcript of all sessions)
