Usage:   proecho PORT TEXT ...
         (use "~" to insert newlines)

Sets ERRORLEVEL 0 if carrier present.

Example: proecho 1 ~Testing your uploads.  Please wait...~~


ProECHO is used in door batch files to send messages to the com port. It 
will not lock up with 'write fault' in case of carrier loss.   This 
program was originally written for use by ProDOOR, but can be used in 
any application where messages must be sent to the modem.   The only 
restriction is that carrier must be present. 


ProECHO can also be used in batch files to check if carrier is present. 
For example: 

   proecho 1 ~
   if errorlevel 1 goto nocarrier
   rem carrier is present

   :nocarrier
   rem carrier is not present


NOTE:
        PROECHO.EXE replaces PROECHO.COM in systems that use
        non-standard com ports via the COMBASE and COMIRQ environment
        variables.  If you wish to use PROECHO.EXE, please make sure you
        erase all copies of PROECHO.COM.
