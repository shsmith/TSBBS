ProWho - Another DOOR for "ProKit"              (Two doors in 1!
----------------------------------               See XFILE.DOC)

The "WHO UPLOADED THAT FILE?" door for PCBoard!

This door will scan the system download/upload log and list all entries
that mention a specific name.


You may select any full filename for scanning.  The search is done
based on matching keywords (like the Zippy scan function).

You can enter searches like this:
   GOODIE.ARC           ;all access to this file
   JOE JONES            ;all activity by this user
   02-09-1988           ;all activity on this date

These searches can take a few minutes to complete, so please be patient!



Here is a sample configuration file:
   HANDSHAKE
   c:\pcb\main\download.txt
   wwelcom
   wmenu
   wclose

   --------------------------
   Configuration file format:

   line 1 = Driver type (HANDSHAKE, INTERRUPT, BIOS, PCBTRAP)
   line 2 = Download listings filename (download.txt file)
   line 3 = Welcome message filename      \
   line 4 = Main menu filename             \___ "G" added to end
   line 5 = Closing door message filename  /    for graphics mode


Note that this is a generic "text search" door, and it can be applied to
just about any text file.  For example, you could customize the messages
and use it to search a master file cross-listing (such as XFILES) to find
which boards have a specific file.  See XFILE.DOC for more info on this.
