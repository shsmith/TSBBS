ProWho - Another DOOR for "ProKit"
----------------------------------

Welcome to the "XFILE SEARCH" door!

Note that this is a generic "text search" door, and it can be applied to
just about any text file.  For example, you could customize the messages
and use it to search a master file cross-listing (such as XFILES) to find
which boards have a specific file.

The sample file XFILE.DOC is only a small portion of Cliff Peterson's
Phoenix area file cross reference.  If you want the whole listing, please
download XFIL1287.ARC (or newer).
