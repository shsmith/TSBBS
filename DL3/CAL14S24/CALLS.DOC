                 =================================

Added logic to strip the leading 'CONNECT' or 'CARRIER' from the connect
types report.

Added logic to count opening chat doors as a "node chat".

Added logic to count all (Local) connect types as sysop local sessions.

Added SUBTITLE option to allow a variable subtitle to be included in
each report.

Added PEAK AUTO option to automatically report the top 6 hours as the
peak hours of the day.

Version 14s24 29-Oct-92 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Corrected an error that would cause a lockup on OPENED DOOR log entries
that contain "\" as part of the doorname.

Version 14s23 09-Jan-92 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The "security level" reports were generating duplicate entries for some
security levels.  You will have to delete CALLS.SAV and let CALLS
rebuild it.

Version 14s22 08-Dec-91 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Changed to accept new format of "new user registration" and "caller
security level" enerated by pcboard 14.5.

Version 14s21 17-Jan-91 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Added new report code 'R' to report "Minutes Used by Security Level".
Renamed report code 'O' to "Number of Calls by Security Level".

Version 14s20 13-Apr-90 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The "Free Download" and "Connect Type" reports were being interchanged
in the .SAV file; this has been corrected, but old .SAV files must be
rebuilt before these reports will be correct.

Added new EVENTMODE option to control how event time is reported.  The
options are:

        EVENTMODE OFF   ;this option disables calculation of event
                        ;duration

        EVENTMODE BUSY  ;this mode calculates event duration and
                        ;accounts for it as 'busy' time (i.e. the system
                        ;was in use during this time)

        EVENTMODE IDLE  ;this mode calculates event duration and
                        ;accounts for it as 'idle' time (i.e. the system
                        ;was NOT in use during this time)

Changed "event duration" reported to average minutes per event instead
of total minutes for all events.

Added 29 new protocol codes:
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ! @ # $ % ^ & * + - < > / [ ] { } ` ~

Added a counter of MarkMail messages left on the system.
Corrected an error in baud rate calculation when baud rates included "E".


Version 14s19 16-Feb-90 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Added reports for ProDoor's "Free Download" feature.  This report is
enabled with report code "Q".  Use the MAXFREE option to control the
maximum number of filenames to be reported.

Moved samples configuration files to a sub-archive.

Version 14s18 13-Jan-90 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Dates after 12-31-89 were not correctly calculated.

Added reports for ProLogon's new "Connect type" and "Security level"
caller log entries.

Version 14s17 04-Jan-90 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


See CALLS.DOC for an explanation of the files included in CAL14S16.ZIP.

Deleted all command line parameters and created a new configuration file
format to control reporting.  See CALLS.CNF for example file format.

Corrected processing of 'NUL' input file option.

Corrected reporting of download efficiency on "G" protocols.

Changed efficiency tables to allow up to 150% in report.

Added libraries to allow shared reading of caller log files.

Added new config file options to control number of entries in conference,
bulletin, doors, and batchSize reports.

Added new config file option to redefine protocol names in report.

Added new config file option to specify alternate CALLS.SAV file name.

Added calculation of time spend processing scheduled events.

Version 14s16 02-Aug-89 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrected logic for determination of first and last log entry dates
on multi-node reports.

Version 14s15 24-Jul-89 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed message formats to support ProDoor 3.1 betas as of 7-12-89.
Added support for new ProLogon baud rate information.

Added support for multi-node reporting.  Append /N to caller file name,
where N is the highest node number.  The program will then sequentially
scan the caller files and combine them for a single report.

Version 14s14 13-Jul-89 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed message formats to support ProDoor 3.0 betas as of 4-9-89.
Added support for 38400 bps connect speeds.

Version 14s13 09-Apr-89 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrected the handling of empty caller logs.  This makes it possible to
generate multiple reports from the same caller log by re-running the
calls program with 'NUL' in place of the caller log filename.
Eliminated the use of Borland's CRT unit.  Ansi codes are now used to
control the local display.

Usage:
-----

calls CALLERS-FILE OUTPUT-FILE REPORT-LIST MIN-DOWNLOAD PEAK-HOURS

CALLERS-FILE is your pcboard CALLER file.  Use "NUL" to repeat previous data.
OUTPUT-FILE  defaults to BLT99
REPORT-LIST  defaults to ANBCDEFGHIJKLM
MIN-DOWNLOAD defaults to 2

PEAK-HOURS   defaults to YNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYYY
                        {0         1         2   }
                        {012345678901234567890123}

The legal REPORT-LIST letters are:
   A: system statistics            B: graphic modes
   C: baud rates                   D: hourly usage
   E: conferences joined           F: bulletins read
   G: doors opened                 H: download protocols
   I: download efficiency          J: upload protocols
   K: upload efficiency            L: batch sizes
   M: files downloaded             N: security statistics
                                   Z: insert a blank line

Examples:

  calls \pcb\main\caller \gen\blt3
            ;uses default report list, min-download and peak-hours.

  calls \pcb\main\caller \gen\blt3 ABCEFG 4 NNNNNNNNYYYYYYYYYNNNNNNN
            ;to specify peak hours you MUST also include 
            ;the report-list and min-download paremeters.

  calls nul \gen\blt-usage D
  calls nul \gen\blt-files M
            ;repeat previous report date in different formats or to
            ;alternate output files


Sample EVENT.SYS lines for two node systems:
-------------------------------------------

rem Update NODE 1 caller log database
cd \pcb1
type \pcb\main\daycal1 >>\pcb\main\caller1
if exist calls.sav     calls \pcb\main\daycal1 \pcb\gen\BLT3 ANBCDEFGHIJKLM 3 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYYNN

Version 14s12 12-Mar-89 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes to allow 'ZIP' to be used instead of 'ARC'.
Fixed some reports where 100.0% exceeded the margins.
Corrected display of 'last caller log entry' on screen.

Version 14s11 27-Feb-89 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rewrote file scanning procedures to sequentially access the caller log.
This makes it possible to report from log files that have been partially
corrupted by a text editor or another program failure.  Added a report
of messages entered via the Qmail door.

Version 14s10 31-Jan-89 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Several statistics were double counting.  Improved format of hourly
utilization graphic.  Added new statistic for CD-ROM library access.
Slight speedup.

Version 14s9 29-Jan-89 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrected an error that prevented the report from counting callers with
'NEW' in their city name!  Uploads are no longer included in the list of
files downloaded.

Version 14s8 10-Jan-89 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed case sensitivity on most caller log entries.

Version 14s7 05-Jan-89 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added color output files.
Added support for 4800 baud connections.
Corrected formatting in bar graphs for items with 100%.

Version 14s6 31-Dec-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed ARC-specific terminology.  Updated for similar changes in
ProDoor betas dated after 10-9-88.

Version 14s4 10-Oct-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a report of "Free Downloads" for compatibility with 9/30
prodoor betas.
Added a "Peak Hours" command line parameter.
Deleted "Time Distribution" report because it was so slow and inaccurate.

Version 14s3 10-03-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated for new conference joined and bulletin read log formats.
Added a check for empty caller log files.

Version 14s2 24-Sep-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated protocol letters for PCBoard 14 compatibility.

Version 14s1 20-Sep-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated new user registration for new PCB 14 message format.

Version 12s21 22-Jul-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added support for node chat.

Version 12s20 22-Jun-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a new data file CALLS.DIR, and a new graph of Time Usage by Activity.
Create the file CALLS.DIR in the current directory.  List all your download
and upload directories in this file (one directory per line).   CALLS will
use this to search for each file that has been downloaded or uploaded.  The
files must be located to determine file size, which is used to calculate the
minutes spent downloading and uploading.  File sizes are determined only the
first time a file is seen.

Version 12s19 12-Jun-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed ARCM message counter to a long integer to prevent overflows.

Version 12s17 10-May-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added support for ProDoor's new ARC Mail feature.

Version 12s16 16-Apr-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added checks for 24:xx instead of 00:xx in some caller log entries.
Should prevent some runtime errors.

Version 12s15 12-Mar-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Recompiled with stack and range check enabled - slower, but safer.

Version 12s14 11-Feb-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved bulletin activity report formatting.
Made changes to allow caller logs with over 32000 entries.  Changed graphics
to allow > 100% (for MNP modems in efficiency reporting).

Version 12s13 11-Feb-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Made the 'remote dos time' statistic work properly (broken ever since
PCB 12.)   Added entries in protocol table for all letters of
the aplhabet.

Version 12s12 19-Jan-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Added the ability to store an internal summary of your caller log. 
This makes it possible to add small daily caller logs and produce 
the full report without keeping the whole caller log on file.  It 
also reduces time spent scanning the log file. 

Each time CALLS is run, it looks for CALLS.SAV in the default 
directory.  If it is present, it loads this "saved summary" into 
memory and adds the specified caller file to it.  After the report 
is generated, CALLS.SAV is updated to include the new data.   Here 
is a recommended EVENT.SYS sequence: 

     1. cd \pcb
     2. calls main\daycal gen\blt3 zzAzNBCDEFGHIJKLM 2
     3. type main\daycal >>main\caller
     4. del main\daycal

Use PCBSETUP to change the caller log filename from the usual 
'caller' to 'daycal' - this will be your "daily caller log".   

Line 2 runs the caller log report on the daily log and generates 
BLT3.  Line 3 adds the daily caller log to the end of the 
"historical" caller log.  Line 4 deletes the daily log (pcboard 
will make a new one for you).   

If you are short on disk space, you don't even need to keep the 
'main\caller' - just delete it.  The information in CALLS.SAV will 
be enough to generate the full caller log report. 

If for some reason you want to start over with a fresh log, just 
delete 'calls.sav' and calls.exe will create a new one for you.   

If you don't want to take advantage of this 'daily caller log' 
feature, just add the line 
   del calls.sav
before the 'calls \pcb\main ...' line in your event.sys - without 
the .sav file, it will act just like it used to. 

Note: if you run CALLS twice on the same caller log, the 
information will be added to CALLS.SAV twice!  So, either make a 
backup copy of CALLS.SAV, or always delete daycal when you run 
calls. 

Version 12s11 16-Jan-88 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Moved security related statistics to a new report (code 'N'). Added 
a fourth parameter to specify the minimum number of downloads 
needed to include a file in the files-downloaded report. 

Version 12s10 31-Dec-87 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorted entries in system statistics report.  Added reporting of 
Archive test runs, archive extract runs and re-arc runs. 

Version 12s9 27-Dec-87 S.H.Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a third command-line parameter to specify the reports to 
generate. This lists the specific report sections to produce and 
the order in which they will appear.   

If, for example, you wanted to produce only the hourly usage (D), 
bulletins read (F), and system statistics (A) reports (in that 
order), the command line would be: 
   calls \pcb\main\caller \pcb\gen\blt3 DFA

                      ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION
                      ======================


Phoenix Arizona                                  Feb 23, 1987

     This documentation covers version 11.8 of CALLS118.COM, a 
call analyzer for PCBoard 11.8. 
     It was written in Turbo Pascal, and is in it's 7th update 
with this version.  Previous versions had various names and 
version numbers such as "pcbcalls", "calls5b" etc.  From now on, 
it will carry the same version number as PCBoard.  If any 
revisions are made or required, it will have a letter suffix. (ie 
117b). 
     This version contains only minor mods to include changes made 
in going from 11.6 to 11.7.  The Imodem and Gmodem protocols have 
been added, some minor cleanup was done on the displays, and the 
error file, BLT99.DOC has been eliminated as redundant and of not 
much value. 

OPERATION

     This version works pretty much the same as all previous 
versions with the exception that the error file "BLT99.DOC" has 
been eliminated. 
     The program is very easy to run, requiring only access to the 
callers file.  This can be done in one of two ways: If you run it 
from your 'MAIN' dir, you can just type CALLS118 and it will 
default to an input file name of "CALLERS" and an called 
"CALLFILE.DOC". 
     It will also support command line parameters, so you can use 
it in a batch file or in your "EVENT.SYS" file, as I do. The .COM 
file should be in your \PCB dir, though this is not required.  
Below is a sample of part of my .SYS file: 

  calls117 d:\pcb\main\callers e:\pcb\gen\blt10

Both parameters should be specified: the first one tells it where 
to find the file (d:\pcb\main\callers) and the name of the callers 
file.  The second tells it where to put the output file, in this 
case I am sending it to Drive D with the name "BLT10". 

There are a couple of things that make for better operation: 
  1.  Do not mix callers logs of pcboard 10.0 and 11.7.  I have
heard of no problems mixing 11.6, 11.7 and 11.8.
  2.  For proper operation, your clock and date MUST be correct; if 
the programs finds that your log begins in 1987 and ends in 1980, 
it will usually abort.  If not, the numbers will be totally wrong 
in most cases. 
  It is recommended, though not required, that you start a new 
callers log if you are new to this program.  It is most accurate 
when the log begins with "New callers log initiated "etc. 

     Please give it a try and let me know what you think of it, as 
the only way I can put in needed changes is with feedback from the 
users.  You can leave any comments at my board (Phoenix Techline) 
at 602 936-3058 (1200-9600), 24 hours. 

     I have included the source code in this version so that it may 
be customized if you desire.  If you make any major changes or 
improvements, please upload them to my board at 602 936 3058.
