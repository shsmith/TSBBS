 ----- FIVE New VARS for ProLON Version 1.31  (One new since 1.3) ------

  NOTE:  Upper and Lower case is NOT important.

         They [should] be in your PROLON.CNF file.  If you like my
         DEFAULTS, you don't need to add them.  If you DON'T like
         my defaults, you will need to ADD THEM YOURSELF and set
         them to your preferences.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE_NET OFF    (ON, OFF, Default=OFF)
  ; For now, you can safely have this OFF.  Used to
  ; access and update USERNET.XXX every 30 seconds.

SHOW_PLUS OFF     (ON, OFF, Default=OFF)
  ; Some like the "+" on the blank call-waiting
  ; screen, and some do not.

NEW_PANEL ON     (ON, OFF, Default=ON)
  ; Whether or not to use the NEW call-waiting
  ; screen that shows BBS usage. New Callers,
  ; Messages, Uploads, downloads, etc.
  ; PgDn on the Call-Waiting screen will toggle
  ; between NODE and SYSTEM-WIDE stats.
  ; To get SYSTEM-WIDE usage stats, all nodes
  ; must have the same SET USAGE_FILE= file.
  ; See the SETS for more information.

FORCE_MSG_SCAN ALL  (OFF, ALL, MAIN, Default=MAIN)
  ; Forces a SCAN MAIN BOARD ONLY or a
  ; SCAN ALL conferences for messages.
  ;
  ; If set to MAIN, the caller will be asked
  ; if they want to SCAN ALL in addition to
  ; the SCAN MAIN.
  ;
  ; If set to OFF, the caller will get the normal
  ; "Scan Main Board for Messages" prompt.
  ;
  ; If set to ALL or MAIN, the caller will NOT
  ; even get the prompt - the scan will be FORCED !

FORCE_SCAN_COMMAND N  (N, Y, S, Default=N)
  ; The "J ?" command to use when FORCE is on.
  ; ie.    N = J N    Y = J Y   S = J S
  ;        N=NEW      Y=YOUR    S=STATS
  ;
  ; Has the same effect as if the user typed it
  ; on the command line.
  ;
  ; Each of these commands will produce different
  ; results, you should experiment to see which
  ; one you prefer the best.
  ;
  ; I use the "N" for ALL NEW messages and it seems
  ; to do the trick... no more "I LEFT A MESSAGE",
  ; "WHY DIDN'T YOU ANSWER ?"   Heck, I DID !!!
  ;
  ; ... or, he left the message in Conference 3,
  ; and didn't see the response because he never
  ; went back in, and expects it to be in the Main.
  ; He'll see it now.... it is FORCED !!
