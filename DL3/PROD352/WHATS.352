To Install:
-----------
If you already have ProDoor 3.51 and ProLogon 1.31, all you
need to do is replace your existing PRODOOR.EXE and PROLON.EXE.
If you do NOT have 3.51 and 1.31, you should run the INSTALL
program.


What's 3.52??
-------------
Sorry, but we found a few problems with ProLogon 1.31 and
ProDoor 3.51.  I was going to wait for the next official
release but some of the problems were real annoying so
rather than wait, here's the new code and the changes now!


ProDoor/ProLogon Changes/Fixes since 3.51/1.31   Status  Date
------------------------------------------------ ------ -----
Another problem with DISP !!!  Fixed............ (done) 03/04
More prompt at file listing won't take dir#..... (done) 03/04
PgUp to get caller password not working......... (done) 03/03
Missed RU command in table of good commands..... (done) 03/03
Missing security lvl in callerlog if force scan. (done) 03/01



New Feature:
------------
 A bonus to you, for my missing the bugs listed above.

 1. Do a SET COMMENT_FILE=C:\PCB\GEN\COMMENTS
 2. Create that file, and add keywords, a comma, and then a
    security level.

  example:

    SCREW,0
    _UCK,0      <--- you know what it is!
    EAT ME,0
    SHIT,0
    FRIEND,20
    BBS LIST,25

 Now... when a NEW CALLER calls, these "keywords" will be checked
 against what-ever they put in their "User Comment Field #1".
 Mine asks.. "How did you hear about us??".

 If ANY keyword phrase is found in their comment field... they'll get
 the corresponding security level for that keyword INSTEAD of the
 security level you have set for all new callers.
 Again... INSTEAD of the value you have set for all new callers.

 You can use this to DUMP obnoxious callers, and even UPGRADE callers
 depending on what they say here.  Use it WISELY !!

 Anything goes... any word, any phrase, any level.

 NOTE:  To DISABLE this "feature", just remove the SET.

 Good Luck.
