Release notes for ProDoor 3.43                          10-22-91
==============================

ProDoor 3.43 is a minor release fixing known bugs in ProDoor 3.42.

This version does not include a new manual, and does not require and
data or configuration file changes compared to prodoor 3.41.

Please read !PRODOOR.NEW for details on exactly what's been changed.

See !UPDATE.341 and !UPDATE.342 for other update information.



Installation
------------

Install PRODOR34.ZIP as instructed in the enclosed documentation.

Then replace the PRODOOR.EXE file with the new one provided in PROD342.ZIP.

All file formats of ProDoor 3.4 are still recognized; no file
conversions or changes are required.

This update corrects the process of logging bidirectional uploads.  3.42
would log all bidirectional uploads as having errors.  This update
properly reads the DSZ.LOG file and extracts error counts and average
speeds for both transmits and receives.

This update is compatible with my new protocol, HS/Link.  To install the
current HS/Link beta into prodoor, add the following lines at the end of
the PROD.CNF file:

;
95 H 0 T 50 HS/Link (Bi-directional)
hslink -p$N$ -u$PLAY$ $@$
;
95 H 0 R 0 HS/Link
hslink -p$N$ -u$PLAY$
;

And copy HSLINK.EXE into a PATH directory.   The current HSLINK beta is
posted as HSLK10B3.ZIP, but this will probably change as HS/Link betas
develop.

HS/Link is not _just_ another bidirectional protocol, it is also a very
fast protocol for normal downloading and uploading, incorporating some
new ideas (such as Full-Streaming-Error-Correction and Dynamic-Code-
Substitution) to make things happen a bit faster.  I may also release
source code under some form of my SourceWare concept.


Optional Files
--------------

The overlay version of ProDoor 3.43 is posted as PROD343O.ZIP.
