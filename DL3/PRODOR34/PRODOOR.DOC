                                   WHY USE ProDoor?

     Even though PCBoard 14.5 has duplicated many of ProDoor's unique features,
     there are still a number of features that make ProDoor worth consideration. 

     Here are some of the features that are still unique to ProDoor 3.4:

     o    Automatic FILE and BYTE upload/download ratios.  ProDoor's ratio
          system works automatically and immediately, eliminating the need for a
          batch update or an outside program to adjust ratios.

     o    Command translation files.  ProDoor allows the system operator to
          redefine all commands, and to include new commands into the system by
          means of command translation files.  These command translations can be
          security level, language and/or conference specific, allowing total
          sysop control.

     o    Enhanced help system.  ProDoor now includes a very flexible help
          system that allows you to put multiple topics and subtopics into a
          single help file, greatly reducing the number of help files needed,
          and at the same time allowing for more detailed and informative online
          help for users.  As always, it is possible to have multiple help
          files, providing simplified information for beginning users and/or
          detailed information for experts.

     o    Virtually all text files that can be displayed are automatically
          available in security level, language and/or conference specific
          versions, allowing the sysop great flexibility.

     o    Simplified user interface.  ProDoor has an intelligent user interface
          that can provide the user with meaningful defaults in most instances,
          instead of relying on the user to provide the exact command syntax. 
          For instance, when reading messages the default automatically changes
          from reading messages to joining the next conference when the end of a
          conference is reached.  This, combined with ProDoor's command
          translation feature allows the sysop to address specific trouble spots
          with new commands or prompts to help novice users.

     o    Partial file downloads.  ProDoor has the ability to split up large
          zipfiles into smaller parts that can then be downloaded.  This feature
          allows users with insufficient time for download of large files to
          still receive the file in two or more parts, or to receive only the
          parts that are of interest.  ProDoor can also convert compressed files
          from one compression format to another, allowing non-ibm users to
          access files without multiple compression formats being posted online.

     o    Upload duplication control.  ProDoor's PRODUP file allows the sysop to
          prevent duplicated uploads between conferences even when the users are
          not normally able to download without being in the proper conference.

     o    Conference control.  ProDoor's JOIN command is quite flexible and has
          subfunctions to allow a direct text-search of the conference menu to
          allow users to locate the desired conference on large systems.  The
          JOIN command also has a specific command translation file, allowing
          the J command to act differently from different conferences and for
          different user security levels.  This makes it possible to devise a
          "tree" or other non-linear structure on your conferences.

                                 OVERVIEW OF FEATURES

     o    Instant installation with interactive install program.

     o    Command translation facility allows the sysop to redefine all major
          commands according to user security levels and current language.

     o    Quick file location system, eliminates time consuming disk accesses
          radically speeding download file searches on large networks and CD-ROM
          systems.

     o    Output message translation system can be used to change any prompt or
          message in ProDoor, and to support alternate language operation.

     o    New automatic File or Byte ratio system.  Allows total sysop control
          over byte and/or file ratios by security level.   Automatically checks
          for proper ratios before each download request -- no more need for
          event based ratio checks and multiple security levels.

     o    New PRODUP file prevents upload duplication between conferences.

     o    File display system allows sysop defined alternate display files for
          each security level.  New macro system allows direct control over
          color displays without the need for ANSI codes.

     o    New DSZ-compatible non standard COM ports COM3 through COM8.

     o    Enhanced file manipulation and transfer. Batch file transfers are
          fully and safely supported.  All uploads are tested to eliminate bad
          archives.  Wildcards are supported.  Files may be flagged for download
          at any prompt and later downloaded in a single batch. 

     o    Extended zipfile/archive manipulation. Users can view archive text
          files online, download partial archives, test archive validity, and
          repack to convert formats.  Multiple compression formats are supported
          and all archive calls are external for sysop customization.

     o    Enhanced message base facilities.  Full-screen "Visual Edit" is
          available for message entry.  Automatic quotations from original
          messages.  ZipM command zips all new mail for downloading.  Keyword
          search through an entire message base.  Simplified command formats. 
          Auto-join for automatic multi-conference reading.

     o    Enhanced sysop features.  Full control of time charges by function. 
          Interactive configuration program.  Continuous status display (even
          during file transfers), many sysop function keys, file input in CHAT
          mode.  Complete session logging.

     o    Automatic support for EGA/VGA 43+ line display modes.

                                       FEATURES
     COMMAND SET

     ProDoor enhances and/or changes many of PCBoard's commands.  See the
     command reference at the end of this document for a complete description of
     all online commands.


     ENHANCED FILE MANIPULATION AND TRANSFER

     +    User may flag files for later download at any "More?" prompt.

     +    Command stacking can be used after the "N" at any "More" prompt.

     +    Upload test procedure can be configured to automatically convert files
          to the default format before posting in upload directory.

     +    Supports up to 100 different file transfer protocols.  Protocols are
          defined in a configuration file - they are not hard coded.

     +    Fully supports both BATCH and single-file protocols,  send and
          receive.  File duplication is prevented, even with batch upload
          protocols.  Full file security is provided through FSEC, UPSEC and
          PRODUP files.

     +    Automatically supports "bi-directional" protocols that allow user
          uploading during file downloads.

     +    Wildcard filename specifications are allowed for all commands.

     +    Upload descriptions are accepted before the file transfer begins
          (except for wildcard/batch uploads, which are accepted AFTER the
          transfer, when the filenames are known.)

     +    Automatic selection of (L)ocate or (Z)ip search.  The search will
          always work - if the user enters 'wildcards' or a keyword.


     EXTENDED ARCHIVE/ZIPFILE MANIPULATION

     +    Users can view zipfile text files online.

     +    Partial (SCRATCH) archives can be created and downloaded.

     +    Archives can be tested for validity before downloading.

     +    A REPACK command converts between all supported archive formats.

     +    All archive functions are external, allowing sysop selection of
          archive format to be used.

     +    Default configuration supports ZIP, ARC, PAK, ZOO and LZH file
          compression formats.





                                          5





     ENHANCED MESSAGE BASE FACILITIES

     +    Full-screen "Visual Edit" is available for remote and local message
          entry.  Supports the ANSI-BBS and DOORWAY code set for cursor motion
          and function key decoding.  No more "line editing"!

     +    The original message is always available for display and automatic
          quotation during new message entry.

     +    The Visual Editor includes a powerful Paragraph Reformat command and
          automatic full-paragraph reformat during text insertion.

     +    Message subjects may contain mixed upper/lower case.

     +    ZIPM command zips new mail in selected conferences for downloading and
          offline reading.

     +    Optional display of sender's CITY and LAST LOGON DATE in all message
          headers.

     +    Optional sysop-only display of sender's SECURITY LEVEL in all message
          headers.

     +    Keyword search through an entire message base.

     +    Reduced clutter in message displays.  Message headers are shortened or
          omitted when possible.

     +    Simplified command formats.  More forgiving; does not require exact
          message numbers.


     ENHANCED SYSOP FEATURES

     +    New command translation facility allows the sysop to redefine all
          major commands according to user security levels and current language.

     +    New system of quick file location, eliminates time consuming disk
          accesses radically speeding download file searches on large networks
          and CD-ROM systems.

     +    New output message translation system can be used to change any prompt
          or message in ProDoor, and to support alternate language operation.

     +    Complete session logging.
          Everything the user sees can be captured in a session log.  This is
          enabled by adding
                     SET PRODEBUG=ON
          to the door script; output will be logged to DEBUG.OUT.

     +    Operation under DoubleDOS, TaskView or DesqView is fully supported. 
          The door will give up idle time to speed the other partition.  If
          screen bleedthrough or background lockups occur, you may need to add
          the environment statement
                     SET OVCRT=ON
          before executing the door.


                                          6




     +    Automatic network file sharing is implemented on all system files. 
          The door has been tested under LanTastic, Novell, NTNX and other true 
          networks.

     +    Sysop function keys are supported:

                                    CUSTOMIZATION

     MESSAGE FILES

     Message text files can be edited to give ProDoor a personalized look.

     All display files can refer to special "macros" that are possibly different
     for each caller.  ProDoor supports both PCBoard-compatible @ macros as well
     as it's own unique $ macros.  See the next section for a complete listing
     of supported macros.


     ProDoor looks for several variations on each message file.  

     +    In GRAPHICS mode, ProDoor appends "G" to the file name.  

     +    When an alternate language is selected, ProDoor appends ".LNG" to the
          file name.  

     +    ProDoor also checks for ".nnn" files, where nnn is the current
          conference number.

     +    ProDoor substitutes the first three letters of a filename with the
          user's security level, and if found, uses this file as a security-
          level specific version of the display file.  This substitution works
          in conjunction with the G and .LNG or .NNN tails listed earlier.

     ONLINE HELP SYSTEM

     ProDoor now contains a powerful online help system.  This system allows a
     single help file to contain a number of different help topics, which can be
     selectively displayed by the user.  This system eliminates the need for a
     large number of different help files, and makes it possible to branch to
     sub-topics for further explanation following each help topic displayed.


     The online help system is active with the following display files:

     PROENTR         This is the help file for message entry in the read mail
                     section.

     PROFV           This is the help for the (F V) and (VX) functions prompt.

     PROHELP         This is the main prompt Help file.  It is printed when the
                     caller uses the (H)elp option.

     PROMAIL         This is the help file for the (R)ead mail function. Remove
                     this file to disable the mail section..

     PROMORE         This is the help file for all "More?" prompts.

     PROREAD         These files provide the novice mode "menu" display at the
                     Mail Command prompt.

     PROVIS          This is the help file for the Visual Editor (message
                     entry).



     HELP FILE FORMAT

     Help files begin with an initial display to the user, followed by one or
     more additional help topics and or subtopics.

     The last line of the initial display text must contain only "~".  This
     indicates to the help system that the user should be prompted to specify
     the topic or subtopic for additional help.

     Each topic of subtopic begins with one or more "keywords", which are
     matched by the user entered topic string.  Keywords begin with ":" and must
     be entirely upper case.  You may include more than one keyword in each
     topic block.  Following the keywords is a block of display text, which will
     be displayed to the caller.

     If the caller is to be prompted for additional subtopics, the topic block
     should end with a line containing a single "~".  If there are no additional
     subtopics, the block should end with a line containing a double "~~".








                                          13





     Sample help file (PROENTR):

          ---------------------------------------------------

          Help is available on the following Message Entry topics:


          [A] Abort        [E] Edit        [L] List      [S] Save
          [C] Continue     [F] Find *      [O] Original  [V] Visual
          [D] Delete       [I] Insert      [Q] Quote

                        [Summary]       [Examples]

          Enter in the text inside the square brackets ie: F for FIND

          ~
          :?
          Please type one of the indicated topics for additional help.
          Press <ENTER> alone to exit the help system.
          ~~
          :A
          (A)bort     Throw away the message and return to reading messages. 
          ~~
          :C
          (C)ontinue  Continue message text input from where you left off.
          ~~
          :D
          (D)elete    Allows you to delete a line from the message. 
          ~~


     You can activate the online help system in any text file by including the
     line
          $HELPFILE$
     at the top of the file.  This allows you to create interactive multi-topic
     bulletins and menus.

     ARCHIVE FUNCTION BATCH FILES

     The archive functions LIB, TEST and REPACK all call batch files to perform
     the actual manipulation.  These files should not need any modification for
     a normal installation.

     PROARCM.BAT
          Called by archive mail function to compress the text mail capture into
          an archive for download.

     PROLIB.BAT
          Called to process the LIBrary request function.

     PROUTEST.BAT
          Called to test new uploads.  This file is also called after downloads
          to check for bi-directional uploads.

     PROUT1.BAT
          Repeatedly called by PROUTEST.BAT for each individual file in an
          upload batch.  This file is responsible for verifying correctness of
          upload files, and for converting from alternate compression formats.

     PRO-P.BAT
          Called by (REPACK) command to convert archive files from one format to
          another.

     PRO-T.BAT
          Called by (TEST) command to test an archive file for validity.

     PRO-R.BAT
          Initially called by (F V)iew and later by the (R)elist command to list
          member files in an archive.  This is where you install ARCTV, ZIPTV,
          LZHTV, etc. for interactive text viewing.

     PRO-V.BAT
          Called by (V)iew subfunction of (F V) to extract a text member from an
          archive file so it can be displayed by ProDoor.

     PRO-X.BAT
          Called by (X)tract subfunction of (F V) to extract a member file from
          one archive file to a "scratch" file for downloading.

     ARCHIVE FUNCTION PROGRAMS

     The standard archive function batch files support a variety of compressed
     file formats.  Because of this, you will need a number of different
     programs to make this feature fully operational.  If any of these programs
     are missing, ProDoor will automatically generate an error message to help
     you pinpoint which program is needed.   If you prefer to support only 1
     file format on your system, see the alternate version of these files posted
     as PROZIP.ZIP on the Tool Shop.

     PROX* - COMMAND TRANSLATION

     ProDoor allows the sysop to translate user input before it is processed by
     ProDoor.  This means you can define new command words as replacements for
     existing commands.  This function works according to user security level,
     making it possible to change the operation of the system for users of
     different levels.  This file is also language-specific so you can set up
     different command sets for each language you support.


     Command translation is active at the following prompts:

     Translation File  . . . . Active prompt

          PROXMAIN . . . . . . Main Command prompt
          PROXMORE . . . . . . "More?" and "press enter to continue" prompts

     PROTRNS - OUTPUT/DISPLAY TRANSLATION

     ProDoor's "output translation" system allows you to specify any list of
     arbitrary messages, and the replacement text to be output to the user
     instead.  These translations are controlled by the file PROTRNS for the
     default language, and by the file PROTRNS.LNG for operation in language
     "LNG".  (This is the way PCBoard selects PCBTEXT files).  If the PROTRNS
     file is missing, no output translation will take place.

     The format of the PROTRNS file is

             ORIGINAL MESSAGE TEXT 1
             REPLACEMENT MESSAGE TEXT 1
             ORIGINAL MESSAGE TEXT 2
             REPLACEMENT MESSAGE TEXT 2
             ORIGINAL MESSAGE TEXT 3
             REPLACEMENT MESSAGE TEXT 3
             ...

     Each translation takes two lines: the first line specifies the ORIGINAL
     text to look for, and the second line specifies the REPLACEMENT text that
     will be output to the user.

     ProDoor checks for the LAST translations FIRST, then works backward to the
     start of the translation list.  It stops when a translation takes place
     (you can't translate translations, in other words).

     Translations work only on exactly matching strings, which are output as a
     single unit.  The best way to determine the exact text for a translation is
     to activate ProDoor in "translation assist" mode.  To do this, execute the
     statement
             SET PROTRNS=ON
     immediately prior to running ProDoor.  When this environment statement is
     present, the door will output (enclosed in {...}) all text strings that can
     be translated, exactly as they must appear in the translation file.


     The sample PROTRNS file includes the following translations:

     [@INCONF@] Command?
     @INCONF@ ($CONFNUM$) Command?
     [@INCONF@] Mail Command:
     @INCONF@ ($CONFNUM$) Mail Command:

     These two translations change the main prompts from
             [CONFERENCE] Command?
     to instead say
             CONFERENCE (CONFERENCE-NUMBER) Command?

     As you can see, all of the @...@ and $...$ variables are active during
     message translation.

          *  MANY SYSTEMS HAVE VERY LIMITED ENVIRONMENT SPACE.    *
          *  IF YOU GET THE MESSAGE "OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE"    *

     ProDoor recognizes the following SET commands when placed in your PRODOOR
     script, BOARD.BAT or AUTOEXEC.BAT files:

     SET CONFINFO=C:\PROD\CONFINFO
          This setting allows ProDoor and ProEdit to specify the file location
          for the conference definitions.  This is needed on network systems
          where multiple 'CNAMES' files are used.  You need to assign a
          different CONFINFO file for each different CNAMES file on your
          network.  Without this environment variable setting ProDoor defaults
          to the file 'CONFINFO' in the ProDoor directory.

     SET EXTUSER=C:\PROD\EXTUSER
          This setting allows ProDoor and ProEdit to specify the file location
          for the extended conference pointers.  This is needed on network
          systems to insure that all nodes share a common EXTUSER file. Without
          this environment variable setting ProDoor defaults to the file
          'EXTUSER' in the Pro-Door directory.

     SET DSZLOG=C:\PCB1\$DOOR.LOG
          This setting allows ProDoor to take advantage of DSZ's logfile data in
          recording the results of a file transfer.  This file *MUST* be located
          in the node's 'system' directory (where the PCBOARD.DAT file is). 
          When $DOOR.LOG is not present after a transfer, ProDoor will attempt
          to simulate the missing data, but will not be able to determine
          individual file CPS ratings or abort/valid status.

     SET TAGLINE=text added to tagline
          Adds the specified text to the "Via ProDoor" line during message
          entry.

     SET OVCRT=ON
          This environment enables a special CRT update mode that works best
          with TaskView or OmniView systems.  NOTE: PLEASE USE THIS ENVIRONMENT
          VARIABLE IF YOU GET "SCREEN BLEEDING" OR "BACKGROUND LOCKUPS" ON
          MULTI-TASKING SYSTEMS.

     SET EDITOR=program
          This environment specifies the program to be used as the text editor
          for configuration files while in PROSM.  The default editor is 'Q'.

     SET CAPFILE=filename
          This setting controls the name of the file generated by the ALT-F
          (file out) and SET PRODEBUG=ON functions.  The default file name of
          DEBUGxx.OUT is changed to the specified name.

                                          19





     SET PRODEBUG=ON
          Enables total session logging to the file DEBUG.OUT.  Use this to
          record door activity for later review.

     SET PROTRNS=ON
          Enables a special display to assist in creation of PROTRNS output
          translation files.  When present, this causes ProDoor to output all
          translatable messages enclosed in {...} prior to the actual
          translation.

     SET ECHOFLAG=ON
          Causes ProDoor to create the file 'ECHOFLAG' in the ProDoor directory
          whenever a user enters an "ECHO" message.  Network mail programs can
          then check for the presence of this file to determine if a mail run is
          required.

     SET COMBASE=nnnn
          Sets the base I/O address (in DECIMAL) for non-standard COM ports. 
          Use this in conjunction with the COMIRQ environment variable.

     SET COMIRQ=n
          Sets the IRQ level for non-standard COM ports.  Use this in
          conjunction with the COMBASE environment variable.

     SET COMSPEC=C:\COMMAND.COM
          This environment variable specifies the location and name of your
          current COMMAND.COM and is used when nested batch files are required.

          * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
          *                        NOTE                           *
          *  THE 'COMSPEC' ENVIRONMENT MUST SPECIFY A .COM        *
          *  FILE!  IF COMSPEC SPECIFIES A .SLV OR .PRG (OR       *
          *  ANYTHING BUT .COM) FILE IT WILL PREVENT ProDoor      *
          *  FROM USING %COMSPEC% TO RUN NESTED BATCH FILES.      *
          * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     SET PATH=C:\DOS;C:\UTIL;C:\...
          The PATH environment variable is used to locate many of the programs
          called up by ProDoor.  Please insure that your archive utilities and
          protocol driver programs are present in a directory listed in your
          PATH environment.

     PROFREE - FREE DOWNLOADS

     You can allow specified files to be "free" downloads for all your users.
     The free files should be listed in the data file PROFREE. You can list any
     number of filespecs, one per line.  Wildcards are allowed.  If a directory
     is specified, the wildcard will apply only to that directory.  Otherwise
     wildcards apply to all download directories.

     Free downloads are not charged as downloads in the user record.  Daily byte
     counts are not used or adjusted.  Use this feature only on files that are
     truly 'free' to the user.  Normal time limits still apply, so think of free
     downloads as working like reading mail or scanning dir listings.

     Sample PROFREE file contents:
        PKZ101.EXE
        TOOLM*.ZIP
        TOOLSHOP.ZIP
        F:\FREE\*.*


     PRODUP - PREVENT DUPLICATE UPLOADS

     ProDoor now checks the optional PRODUP data file for a list of directories
     to scan during upload duplication checking.  This file has the same format
     as the DLPATH file.  Include in the PRODUP file all directories that the
     caller may not be able to download from, but which contain files that may
     duplicate new uploads.  For example, you may wish to include all of your
     conference specific upload and download areas in this file, thus preventing
     duplicate uploads between one conference and another.


     PROPCAN - PASSWORD TRASHCAN

     The PROPCAN file is consulted when a caller attempts to change password
     using the (W)rite-user-info command.  The PROPCAN file contains a list of
     "trashcan" passwords, one per line, that may not be used by callers as a
     password.

     Example PROPCAN file:

          PASSWORD
          NONE
          JUNK
          TEST
          NEW
          PW


     $DOOR.CMD - INITIAL COMMAND LINE

     You can pass an initial command line to ProDoor from outside programs by
     means of the $DOOR.CMD file.  When ProDoor is loaded into memory, if the
     $DOOR.CMD file is present in the pcb system directory, ProDoor will load
     the first line and execute it as though it was typed by the user, but
     without a menu or command line display.  This feature can be used by other
     applications to customize the operation of ProDoor or to automatically
     activate ProDoor features when needed.

                                          21





     PRORATIO - FILE AND BYTE RATIOS

     ProDoor's ratio system works automatically and immediately, eliminating the
     need for a batch update or an outside program to adjust ratios.  The
     PRORATIO file defines for each security level, the required ratio of
     download:upload files and bytes and also determines how to process users
     who have not yet uploaded to the system.

                    PROSM - SYSTEM MANAGER (CONFIGURATION EDITOR)

     The ProDoor System Manager, PROSM.EXE, is an interactive configuration
     utility for use with ProDoor.  It allows you to view and modify the
     contents of ProDoor's PROD.CNF, CONFINFO and EXTUSER data files.

     The INSTALL procedure creates a CONFIG.BAT batch file for you.  Use the
     CONFIG command to run the System Manager.

     The System Manager has eight main functions:


     A - EDIT CONFIGURATION FILE

     The Edit Configuration File function allows you to view and modify the
     contents of ProDoor's PROD.CNF file.


     B - EDIT CONFERENCE DEFINITIONS

     The Edit Conference Definition function is an editor for the CONFINFO file. 
     It allows you to maintain ProDoor and ProEdit conference information for
     ALL message areas available through the door.  Use this selection to define
     "extended" conferences not available from PCBoard.

     This function also has the ability to update your CNAMES file with any
     changes in definitions of conferences.


     C - EDIT EXTENDED USER DATA

     The Edit Extended User Data function is an editor for the EXTUSER file. It
     allows you to maintain conference registration and message pointers for
     ProDoor users.  It displays door usage count, last date in door and allows
     editing of "earned K bytes" record.


     D - Generate ProPack Batch File

     The Generate ProPack Batch File function reads your conference
     configuration data and automatically generates a batch file, PACKALL.BAT,
     which can be used in an event to pack all of your conference message files.

                                          23





     E - INSERT GROUP CONFERENCE

     The Insert Group Conference function allows you to automatically register
     users in a conference according to a range of security levels.


     F - REMOVE GROUP CONFERENCE

     The Remove Group Conference function allows you to automatically remove
     users from a conference according to a range of security levels.


     G - PACK EXTENDED USER FILE

     The Pack Extended User File function updates your USERS and EXTUSER data
     files to include only currently registered users.  The EXTUSER file is
     reordered to follow the order in USERS, speeding the some other functions
     of this program.


     H - MOVE/ARRANGE/DELETE CONFERENCES

     The Arrange/Renumber Conferences function allows you to alter the order of
     your conferences, and to completely delete conferences from the CONFINFO
     file.  The function changes the conference numbers and updates your
     CONFINFO, USERS and EXTUSER data files accordingly.  CNAMES is not updated
     so renumbering conference numbers less than 40 is not recommended.

                               EDIT CONFIGURATION FILE

     The Edit Configuration File function allows you to view and modify the
     contents of ProDoor's PROD.CNF file.

     Use the PGUP and PGDN keys to change pages.  Press ESC to return to the
     System Manager main menu.


     GENERAL CONFIGURATION

     Held (dup) upload listing . . . . C:\PCB\ADMIN\HELD
          This is the filename of the "listing" file for descriptions of "held"
          uploads.

     Held (dup) upload directory . . . C:\PCB\HOLD
          This is the file directory where "HELD" uploads will be stored.   An
          upload is "HELD" for sysop review if it's name duplicates another
          file, conflicts with UPSEC, or contains an invalid character.

     Transfer "PLAYPEN" directory. . . I:\PLAY
          The playpen directory is used to hold uploads, and possibly downloads
          that are in-progress.  In network systems, the node number is
          automatically appended to the end of the directory name.

     Directory for SCRATCH.ZIP . . . . I:\SCR
          This is the directory used to hold the SCRATCH zipfile, used by the
          zipfile extract,  REPACK, and ZIPM functions.  Specify a large RAMDISK
          for fastest operation.  THIS MUST NOT BE THE SAME AS THE 'PLAYPEN'!!!

     Scratch zipfile name prefix . . . TOOLS
          This is used to build the  SCRATCH zipfile filename.  Change this to
          identify your board.  The Tool Shop uses 'TOOLS', for example.

     Mail zipfile name prefix. . . . . TOOLM
          This is used to build the ZIPM zipfile filename.  Change this to
          identify your board.  The Tool Shop uses 'TOOLM', for example. THIS
          MUST NOT BE THE SAME AS THE 'SCRATCH ZIPFILE PREFIX'!!!

          ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
          *   THE 'SCRATCH ZIPFILE NAME PREFIX' AND 'MAIL          * 
          *   ZIPFILE PREFIX' SETTINGS *MUST* BE DIFFERENT!        * 
          *   IF THEY ARE THE SAME, ProDoor WILL SELECT SCRATCH    * 
          *   FILES TWICE SINCE IT LOOKS FOR BOTH NAMES.           * 
          ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

     Max messages per ZIPM run . . . . 500
          This entry controls the maximum number of messages that the Zip Mail
          function will handle in a single run.  Use it to prevent the resulting
          scratch file from being too large.

          ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
          *   PLEASE INSURE THAT YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT DISK SPACE    *

     PROGRAM OPTIONS

     This panel controls program features that are new to version 3.4, or which
     were previously controlled by environment variables.


     Insert "Uploaded by:" for all uploads?
          This option enables the placement of "Uploaded by: USER NAME" into the
          upload directory for each file uploaded.


     Insert blank line after all uploads?
          This option controls the insertion of a blank line after each upload
          entry in the upload directory.  

          NOTE: As of 4/25/90 this feature should not be used if you intend
          to use PCBFILER to sort your upload directory.  As of this date,
          the PCBFILER program cannot handle blank lines in a DIR listing
          and will corrupt the file if you attempt to SORT or to update a
          file with a defined sort order.


     Expand macros in message texts?
          This option controls the @ and $ macros within message texts.  This
          feature gives you control over messages that would otherwise reveal
          system information.  It is used in conjunction with netmail or reader
          programs that do not provide adequate security to prevent the use of
          these macros.  This feature allows you to disable macros in the
          message base, while still keeping the feature in other sysop-defined
          text files.


     Display users CITY in message headers?
          This option causes ProDoor to access the USERS file for each message
          to retrieve the message writer's CITY and LAST ON date so it can be
          displayed with the message.  If a sysop is reading mail, this feature
          also causes the message writer's SECURITY LEVEL to be shown in the
          message header.  If you disable this option it will prevent accessing
          the users file, which will speed up message reading on some systems.


     Require filenames before batch uploads?
          This option, if set to YES, requires that users specify upload
          filenames in advance with protocols that are capable of automatically
          determining filenames.  Use this option to force users to check for
          duplicate uploads in advance of actually uploading to the system.


     Transfer time estimate for (G) default... 30
          Specifies the minimum transfer time estimate (in minutes) that will
          trigger an automatic goodbye after the transfer.  Shorter transfers
          will default to remain in the door and longer transfers will default
          to automatic goodbye.  The user may still override the default, if
          desired.  NOTE: This is new to ProDoor 3.4 and may require manual
          entry during an upgrade from previous versions.

     ARCHIVE MANIPULATION COMMANDS

     Because of the recent conflicts over archive file format standards, ProDoor
     no longer has a hard-coded internal handler for archive file manipulation. 
     Instead, calls are made to outside commands to process archives.  This
     configuration panel allows you to specify the commands (and hence the
     archive file format) that are to be used.

     Please note that the archive commands are loaded "on top of" ProDoor and
     will require additional memory.  Because of this, I recommend that you use
     the "small" version of any archive utility (PKPAKJR, for example).

     Files listing command . . . . . . . . . PRO-R $N$ $TIME$ $R$ 

          Command used to get a listing of files contained inside an archive
          file.  The default is to call PRO-R.BAT, which includes support for
          several common compression formats.

     Type files to console command . . . . . PRO-V $R$
          This command is used to view specified text files within an archive.
          The command must direct the text files into the file specified by the
          "result file" macro $R$.

     Extract from file to file command . . . PRO-X $R$
          This command must extract the specified component files from one
          archive and place them into another, possibly creating a new archive
          in the process.

     RePack archive command. . . . . . . . . PRO-P $R$
          This command is used by the REPACK command.  The standard batch file,
          PRO-P.BAT has the ability to convert among the various formats which
          are supported.

     Test archive integrity command. . . . . PRO-T $R$
          Command used to test the validity of an archive file.

     Test failure message suffix . . . . . . has errors!
          If this message appears in the result file generated by the test
          archive command, the specified archive file will be deleted.  The full
          archive file name must be at the beginning of the line for this
          feature to work.

     EXTENDED SECURITY CONFIGURATION

     The ProDoor Extended Security Configuration panel allows you to control
     access to all door functions.


     Function -
          This entry identifies the function letter being configured.  The
          "spare" entries are reserved for future commands.  Notice that
          "single" and "batch" upload/download functions have different entries. 
          This allows you to restrict batch functions by  security level, if
          desired.


     Security Level -
          This is the minimum security level required for a user to use the
          specified function.


     Time Factor -
          This entry controls how time is "charged" for the use of each
          function.  A time factor of 1.0 is the normal "real time" charge rate. 
          Factors < 1 give the caller more time when using the function. 
          Factors > 1 give the caller less time.  Examples:


          Time factor                          Meaning
          -----------          -----------------------------------------
              1.0              Normal time, as in PCBoard

              0.0              The clock is "stopped" in this function

             -1.0              The user gets extended time equal to the time 
                               spent in this function.

              2.0              The user is charged "double" for time spent in
                               this function.


     Byte Factor -
          This entry applies only to upload and download functions.  It controls
          how the function updates the caller's "Download Bytes Available"
          record.  A value of 1.0 charges the user directly for each byte
          transferred.  A factor or 0 does not charge.  A factor  of -1 gives
          back 1 byte for each byte transferred.   Generally speaking, use 1.0
          for downloads and at least -1 for uploads.  I  use this feature to
          implement a byte-based upload/download  ratio.  With the upload
          factors set at -5, the callers can  download 5 bytes for each byte
          uploaded.  This, coupled with  ProDoor's ability to carry "earned
          bytes" forward from call to  call, allows you to better reward your
          best callers.







                                          28





     (0) Idle time . . . . . .     2               1.5            1.0 

          This function code is used to control the charge for "idle"  time.  A
          time factor of 1.5 will charge callers extra for  letting the board
          sit "idle".

     (1) Download batch. . . .     2               1.0            1.0 
     (2) Upload batch. . . . .     2               -0.5           -5.0 
          These function codes apply to protocols that allow more than 1
          filespec at a time.  NOTICE THAT UPLOADS USE NEGATIVE NUMBERS!

          * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
          *                                                         * 
          *    THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION GRANTS A 'BYTE CREDIT'     * 
          *    OF 5 DOWNLOAD BYTES FOR EACH BYTE UPLOADED.  IF      * 
          *    YOU DO NOT WANT THIS EXTRA DOWNLOAD CREDIT, YOU      * 
          *    MUST CHANGE THE 'UPLOAD' AND 'UPLOAD BATCH' BYTE     * 
          *    FACTORS FROM -5.0 TO 0.0!                            * 
          *                                                         *
          * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     (3) Private message entry     2               1.0            1.0 

          This function code allows you to restrict private message entry  by
          security level.  It also allows you to have a different time  factor
          for public versus private message entry.

     (4) Reply message . . . .     2               1.0            1.0 

          This function code allows you to control the time charges for a public
          message that is in reply to some other message.  This  gives you the
          ability to differentiate between "new" and "old"  message threads.

     EXTENDED PROTOCOL CONFIGURATION

     Protocol
     Name
          This entry is the "name" for the protocol.  It is displayed in the
          protocol menu, and before any transfer in the protocol.

     Menu
     Code
          This is the menu letter used to identify the protocol.

     Trans/
     Recv
          Enter a "T" here if the protocol "transmits" data to the user  (i.e.
          download protocols).  Enter a "R" if the protocol  "receives" data
          from the user (i.e. upload protocols).

     File
     Specs
          This entry controls the number of filespecs that are allowed  with the
          protocol.  There are a few special cases to consider:

                     File
                     Specs                       Meaning
                     -----     -------------------------------------------------
                     1         The protocol is "non batch".  A full filename is
                               passed to the driver program.

                     0         The protocol is "automatic batch UPLOAD".  Use
                               this only with batch "receive" (UPLOAD) protocols
                               that get the filenames from the caller's end of
                               the transfer.

                     2..50     These numbers allow the user to specify a
                               variable number of files for download.  A
                               filespec may  contain wildcards, resulting in up
                               to 50 files in a given batch. If the protocol
                               must have the filenames on the command-line, a
                               value of 2 or 3 is generally the limit. 
                               Protocols that  don't specify every name may use
                               values up to 50.   See the Command Line section
                               for more information on this.


     Estimated
     Efficiency
          This entry is used to estimate how efficient a given protocol is  at
          sending or receiving data.  Legal values range from 0.1 to  0.99.










                                          30





     Command Line
          This entry is the "command line" used to call up the protocol driver. 
          It must be entered exactly as if you were calling up  the driver from
          a DOS prompt.   There are a few special cases on  the command line:

          Entry                             Meaning
          -----      -------------------------------------------------

          $B$        This is replaced with the caller's connect speed, or baud
                     rate.  This is the speed used to open the com port.

          $C$        This is replaced with the caller's actual connect speed,
                     and is used only for file transfer time estimates.

          $N$        This is replaced with the COM port number in use.

          $NODE$     This is replaced with the current node number and can be
                     used to build command-lines in multi node systems.

          $TIME$     This is replaced with the number of minutes of time
                     remaining in the current login.

          $@$        This is replaced with '@c:\pcb\$door.nam', which refers to
                     a file that will list the names of the individual files to
                     be transmitted.  This  feature is only valid for DSZ
                     versions 880423 or  later.  Use this to allow more than 3
                     filespecs  per transfer. 
           
          *.*        Causes ProDoor to copy all of the selected files into the
                     "playpen" directory prior to  starting the transfer.  The
                     door then instructs  the protocol driver to send "all"
                     files from the  playpen.  Use this to allow more than 3 
                     filespecs on any batch-compatible protocol. Because of all
                     the disk activity involved in  copying the files, I
                     recommend you use this  option only if you have a RAM DISK
                     for your  playpen.

          $PLAY$     This is the playpen directory name.  Use this on the end of
                     DSZ upload command lines if you want to use the
                     "destination directory" feature of registered DSZ versions.

                             EDIT CONFERENCE DEFINITIONS

     The Edit Conference Definition function is an editor for the CONFINFO file. 
     It allows you to maintain ProDoor and ProEdit conference information for
     ALL message areas available through the door.  Use this selection to define
     "extended" conferences not available from PCBoard.

     ProDoor compiles the standard CNAMES data file into a random-access file,
     CONFINFO, for quicker access and reduced memory requirements. You may
     define up to 5000 different conferences in this file.

     The PCBoard CNAMES file is accessed ONLY if the CONFINFO file is missing or
     has been manually deleted.  It is up to you to delete CONFINFO (so ProDoor
     will re-build it) if you ever change the contents of your CNAMES file.  If
     the CONFINFO file exists, ProDoor will not automatically recognize changes
     made in your CNAMES file.

     This function also has the ability to update an existing CNAMES file with
     any changes in definitions of conferences that were already in the CNAMES
     file.  It will not extend the CNAMES file.

     Network systems may wish to define multiple CONFINFO files.  To do this,
     you must include the statement
             SET CONFINFO=drive:\directory\filename
     in your calling batch file to specify which CONFINFO file is being
     modified.


     ProDoor automatically creates the EXTUSER file with space allocated for up
     to 90 extended conferences.  If you need more conferences, please download
     the EXTADJ11.ZIP utility, which can expand the file to a full 5000
     conferences.  This utility can also be used to reduce the file to it's
     minimum size (1 extended conference) on small systems.

     F8   Global change.  This function key causes the data in the item under
          the cursor to be copied to ALL conferences.  Use this with caution.

     F9   Initialize the current conference with standard defaults.  Use this
          option to "redefine" an existing conference.  All new values will be
          based on your "Main Board" definitions and the specified new
          conference name.

     F10  Update CNAMES file.  This selection reads all conference definitions
          from the CONFINFO file and updates your standard CNAMES file with the
          latest information.  This means you should not use PCBSETUP to change
          CNAMES data -- use this function key instead.


     DATA ENTRY

     Area Name. . . . . . . . . . Hardware
          This entry defines the Name of the new conference.  This is the
          message printed in the Main Menu Command and Mail Command prompts for
          the conference.  It can also be used with the (J)oin command for
          direct access to a conference, regardless of the conference number.

     Public Conference. . . . . . Y
          This entry defines access for unregistered users in the conference. If
          the setting is 'Y', ProDoor will automatically make a caller a member
          of the conference during the first access.  When set to 'N' the
          conference will be available only to a) callers already registered in
          the conference, and b) callers specifically added to the conference
          through the Extended User File Edit function.

     Minimum Security to Auto-Register . . 89
     Maximum Security to Auto-Register . . 99
          These entries define the range of security levels needed to
          automatically by registered in a PRIVATE conference.  If the user has
          the proper security level, he will automatically enrolled into the
          conference.  This entry has no effect on PUBLIC conferences, which are
          automatically available to all callers, regardless of security level.

     Make all Uploads Private . . N
          This entry controls the posting of new uploads to this conference. If
          set to 'Y', all new uploads will be posted in the private directory. 
          If set to 'N', uploads will be posted to the public upload directory
          (unless the caller requests private uploading with a '/' at the start
          of the description).

     Make ALL Messages Private. . N
          This entry controls the posting of new messages to this conference. If
          set to 'Y', all new messages will be flagged as 'RECEIVER ONLY', and
          must be manually unprotected by the sysop before the public will have
          access to them.  When set to 'N' the message security is specified by
          the caller.  When set to 'A' all messages will be forced to PUBLIC.

     Echo Mail in Conference. . . Y
          This entry controls the "Echo to other systems?" prompt.  If set to
          'Y' the caller will be asked if a new message is to be echoed, and if
          the answer is yes, the "(echo)" flag will be set in the new message.
          If set to 'N' no new message will be given the "(echo)" flag.  If set
          to 'A', all messages will be given ECHO status.

     Added Security . . . . . . . 0__
          This entry allows you to temporarily increase a caller's security
          level while accessing the conference.

     Added Time (minutes) . . . . 0__
          This entry allows you to grant extra time to a caller when joining
          this conference.  The extra time is granted only once per day.  If
          multiple conferences have 'added time', the caller will be granted up
          to the highest 'added time' of the conferences he accesses that day.

     Number of Message Blocks . . 4__
          This entry controls the size of the index file, and therefore the
          maximum number of consecutive message numbers that may be present in a
          conference.  Each block allocates 1024 message numbers.  You are
          allowed up to 32 blocks, but should use 14 or fewer blocks if you are
          using the ProPack utility to pack the conference files.

     ProPack Command Options. . . 2000 drle___
          This entry specifies any options you want to use in conjunction with
          the ProPack utility.  See ProPack documentation for full information
          on options that are available.   This example will pack the message
          file, retain 2000 messages, delete duplicate messages, and delete
          RECEIVED+PRIVATE messages.

     Message File Path Name . . . C:\PCB\HARDWARE\HARDWARE_______ 
          This entry specifies the full filename of the conference message file. 
          The message file and the associated index file will be automatically
          created by ProSM, if needed.

     Conference News Path Name. . C:\PCB\HARDWARE\HNEWS__________
          This entry specifies the conference news message file.  Depending on
          your settings, ProDoor can display the file the first time a caller
          joins a conference during a day.

     Public Upload DIR File . . . C:\PCB\MAIN\DIR14______________ 
     Public Upload Directory. . . E:\UPLOAD\_____________________ 
          These entries control the placement and scanning of public uploads
          while inside this conference.  Since PCBoard's file management
          utilities do not recognize extended conference, I recommend that you
          use only existing upload directories for your extended conferences.
          This will ensure that you will be able to access them for file
          maintenance.

     Private Upload DIR File. . . C:\PCB\MAIN\PRIVATE____________ 
     Private Upload Directory . . E:\PRIVATE\____________________ 
          These entries control the placement of private (or sysop-only) uploads
          while inside the conference.

          The file areas file entry controls the file areas menu display while
          inside this conference.  You should use existing files defined for a
          standard conference so you can use the PCBoard utilities to maintain
          the listing file.  

     Download Paths. . . . (Listing Only). . . . . C:\PCB\GEN\DLPATH.LST_______ 
          The download paths entry controls the listing of download directories
          that are available while inside this conference.  You should use a
          file defined for a standard conference so you can use the PCBoard
          utilities to maintain the listing file.

                               EDIT EXTENDED USER DATA

     The Edit Extended User Data function is an editor for the EXTUSER file. It
     allows you to maintain conference registration and message pointers for
     ProDoor users.  It displays door usage count, last date in door and allows
     editing of "earned K bytes" record.

     ProDoor automatically maintains EXTUSER, the Extended User File.  The file
     stores message pointers for all extended conferences, as well as conference
     registration and scan preferences.

     Some network systems require an environment variable to specify the
     location of the EXTUSER data file to allow sharing by all nodes.  In this
     case, be sure to include the statement
             SET EXTUSER=drive:\directory\filename
     in the calling batch file to specify the proper file path.  This feature
     may also be used to interface with a future version of the Qmail door.


     Here is a typical display:

     Times in ProDoor:  255
     Last in Door: 12-11-88
          These displays show current information about ProDoor users, but
          cannot be modified.  If these entries display "NONE" and "NEVER" it
          indicates that the specified user has not yet been inside ProDoor and
          that there is no corresponding EXTUSER record.  Because of this, only
          the base 40 conferences can be edited for these users.

     User Rec: 0
     ExtUser Rec: 0
          This displays the PCBoard USERS file record number and the
          corresponding EXTUSER record number.

     Earned K Bytes:    783
          This entry records the users total "earned K bytes".  You can position
          the cursor over this entry and enter a new value if desired.

     Security Level:    120
          This entry is a quick way to change a user's security level without
          the need to access PCBSM.

     The extended conference information is presented in tabular form, with five
     columns, each listing 10 conferences.  This format cannot display all
     conferences at once.  Use the F1 [next 40 conferences] and F2 [prior 40
     conferences] function keys to scroll the conference tables left and right,
     to gain access to the desired conference number.  Each conference table is
     presented in this format:
             Cnf  Mem-  Last
             No.  ber   Read
             
             40:   Y   1____
             41:   Y   1____
             42:   Y   6____

     The "Cnf No." entry indicates the conference number being accessed.

     The "Mem-ber" entry controls the user's registration in this conference. If
     the conference is marked "PUBLIC" you don't need to edit your user
     conference registration -- ProDoor will do it automatically the first time
     the caller accesses the conference.   You can change this entry to manually
     enroll a user in a private conference, or to remove a caller from a non
     public conference.

     The "Last Read" entry is the user's message pointer for this conference.

                             ARRANGE/RENUMBER CONFERENCES

     The Arrange/Renumber Conferences function allows you to specify a new
     conference number for each and every defined conference.  The program will
     then update the CNAMES, USERS and EXTUSER files to reflect the new
     conference arrangement.  CNAMES is not updated so renumbering conference
     numbers less than 40 is not recommended.

     Please insure that all NODES are offline before using this function.

                                 SUPPORTING PROGRAMS

     The ProDoor system includes the following supporting programs:

          PRODOOR.EXE
          PROSM.EXE
          BLDLIST.EXE
          PROECHO.COM
          PRONS.COM


     PRODOOR.EXE
          This is the main DOOR program.  It should be called only by the
          PRODOOR door script files.  The overlay version of ProDoor is posted
          as PROD34OV.ZIP and also uses PRODOOR.OVR.


     PROSM.EXE
          This is the ProDoor System Manager program.  It performs the functions
          of CONFIG, INSTALL and CHKPATH.


     BLDLIST.EXE
          This program builds file lists for quick file scans in large network
          systems or systems using slow CD-ROM drives.

          Usage:  BLDLIST dir ... dir [>out]

          You may specify one or more directories to scan.  Subdirectories are
          automatically included, so
                     D:\
          will scan all directories of drive D:, while
                     D:\DL
          will scan D:\DL and all subdirectories under D:\DL.

          Example:
                     BLDLIST C:\DL1 D:\DL2 K:\ >C:\PCB\GEN\DLINFO.DAT
                     BLTLIST L:\COMM L:\GIF L:\EDIT L:\GRAPH
                     >>C:\PCB\GEN\DLINFO.DAT

          You can run BLDLIST multiple times, appending the results to a single
          output listing.

          I recommend you create a batch or EVENT to automatically update this
          listing file if it refers to directories that are being updated.

          ProDoor versions dated 2-26-90 and later are able to process such a
          file list when included in a DLPATH.LST file.  For example:

          DLPATH.LST
          ----------

          U:\UPLOAD\
          M:\SYSOPS\
          M:\MAG\
          @C:\PCB\GEN\DLINFO.DAT
          M:\DISK\

                                          43




          @C:\PCB\GEN\CR-ROM1.DAT

          When a DLPATH entry starts with '@' it is expected to specify the full
          filename of a file-listing file created with BLDLIST.  This can be
          used to speed up searching of slow drives.  You can also use this to
          reduce network traffic if you list network download directories and
          place the listing on a local drive.


     PROECHO.COM
          This is a small program that safely echoes messages to the COM ports,
          and is used mostly in external batch files.

          Usage:   proecho PORT TEXT ...
                     (use "~" to insert newlines)

          Sets ERRORLEVEL 2 if local mode.
          Sets ERRORLEVEL 1 if carrier is NOT present.
          Sets ERRORLEVEL 0 if carrier present.

          Example: proecho 1 ~Testing your uploads.  Please wait...~~

          ProECHO is used in door batch files to send messages to the com port.
          It will not lock up with 'write fault' in case of carrier loss.   


     PRONS.COM
          This is ProDoor's "no scroll" module.  It is a TSR that freezes the
          top half of the screen (containing the last few commands and the
          status lines) during file transfers.

          The first time you run ProNS, it becomes resident and freezes the top
          half of the screen.   From then on, any program that writes to the
          screen via DOS or BIOS or ANSI will be restricted to the bottom of the
          screen.

          The second time you run ProNS, it will be removed from memory,
          restoring the screen to normal.

          This program works under TaskView and other environments that do not
          pass DOS or ANSI outputs to BIOS.

                              ProDoor COMMAND REFERENCE

     ProDoor's Online Commands are divided into the following groups:

          MAIN MENU COMMANDS
          READ MAIL COMMANDS
          MESSAGE ENTRY COMMANDS
          VISUAL EDITOR COMMANDS
          "MORE" PROMPT COMMANDS
          JOIN CONFERENCE COMMANDS


     ProDoor MAIN MENU COMMANDS

     (A)bandon
          Leave current conference and return to the Main Board. Continue
          reading messages.

     (B)ulletin
          Bulletin listings.  List the bulletins available for viewing and the
          date they were placed on the system.

     (C)omment
          Enter a comment message to the sysop.  You specify the 'subject' of
          the message.  The message will be protected so it is seen only by the
          sysop.

     (CHAT)
          Displays the list of callers that are online on other nodes in a
          multi-node system.

     (CHAT U)
          Makes you unavailable for chat requests by other nodes.

     (CHAT ?)
          Reports if you are currently available for chat requests.

     (D)ownload
          "Downloading" refers to moving files from this system to your system.
          You can also "stack" (S)tart or (G)oodbye after the last filename to
          immediately start the transfer. Examples:

               D Z SNOW PLASTIC
               D file S            ;immediately start download of files
               D file1 file2 G     ;immediately start d/l of files, goodbye at
                                   end

     (E)nter
          Enter a new message.  You then specify who the message is to be
          addressed to, as well as the 'subject' of the message. You can protect
          the message so it will be seen only be the 'receiver'.

     (F)ile
          File directory listings.  Lists the names of the files that are
          available on the board for downloading to your system.



                                          46




     (FL)ag
          Flag file for later download.  All flagged files are automatically
          selected for download when you use the (D)ownload command. Note:  you
          will lose your flag list when you use (U)pload, (ZIPM), (TEST) or
          (REPACK) commands.

          Use (FL U) (file) to UN-flag a specific file.
          Use (FL U *) to completely clear the flag list.

     (G)oodbye
          Logs you off the system.  Examples:
               G         ;logoff
               G Q       ;quick logoff, bypass closing bulletins

     (H)elp
          Activates ProDoor's online help system.

     (HO)tkeys
          Enable instant response on most commands.  Eliminates the need to type
          RETURN to activate most commands. In hotkey mode you should use ";"
          (not SPACE) to "stack" commands.  The spacebar acts like RETURN in
          hotkey mode.

     (J)oin
          Allows you to switch to a different conference.  You may specify
          either a conference number or a conference name.

     Insert Mode versus Overtype Mode

     In insert mode, all characters typed are INSERTED before the cursor. The
     ENTER key splits the line and BACKSPACE can re-join lines.

     In overtype mode, characters "type over" what was on the screen before.
     Overtype mode also disables the automatic line SPLIT / JOIN available in
     insert mode.  Use ^N(split) and ^J(join) to manually split and join lines
     while in overtype mode.


     Keyboard emulation

     The easiest way to control the cursor in Visual Edit mode is to use your
     cursor keys.  Most popular terminal programs provide some sort of keyboard
     emulation.  Unfortunately, this emulation is either incomplete or requires
     you to go through an involved configuration process.

     ProDoor also supports the "Doorway" keyboard mode of Qmodem.

     The WordStar* command set was chosen as a control-character command set
     because it can function on virtually any keyboard and with any terminal
     emulation mode.  It also has the advantage of letting you keep your fingers
     on the "home" keys while moving the cursor around.

         In this table, the symbol <esc> means any one of these character code
     sequences:
          chr(27)
          chr(27) [
          chr(27) [ O

     The symbol <nul> means chr(0) or an ascii NUL.  These codes correspond
     directly to the IBM extended scan codes produced by the corresponding
     keyboard keys.  These codes are used if your terminal program supports
     "Doorway" mode.

     This provides support for a wide variety of keyboard emulations.

     ProDoor "MORE" PROMPT COMMANDS

     Most "MORE" prompts include the following commands:

          (Y)es   Continue the current display.
          (NS)    Continue the current display in non-stop mode.
          (N)o    Stop the current display and return to a menu prompt.
          (F)lag  Flag a filename for later downloading.

     In addition, most more prompts allow other commands to be specified. For
     instance, a MORE prompt from the main menu will respond to most main menu
     commands.  A MORE prompt in the mail reader will respond to most mail
     reader commands.

     (Y)es
          Continue the current display. Pressing ENTER also causes the current
          display to continue.

     (N)o
          Stop the current display and return to a menu prompt. You can
          optionally stack the next command after N and it will be immediately
          executed instead of repeating a menu. Displays can also be canceled
          with the ^K command.

     (NS)
          Continue the current display in non-stop mode. Non-stop modes can be
          canceled with the ^K command.

     (F)lag
          Flag a filename for later downloading.

     (F U)
          Unflag specified flags.

     SourceWare: What is it?

     SourceWare is my name for a unique concept in user supported software.
     Programs distributed under the SourceWare concept always offer source code.

     This package can be freely distributed so long as it is not modified or
     sold for profit.  If you find that this program is valuable,  you can send
     me a donation for what you think it is worth.  I suggest about $30.

     Send your registrations to:
                                   Samuel H. Smith
                                    P. O. Box 4808
                             Panorama City, CA 91412-4808

     When you send a registration, your existing user account on The Tool Shop
     will be upgraded for extended time and downloading.  You will also be able
     to download a special "register" program.  The register program allows you
     to install your own "registration" message seen by callers when opening
     ProDoor.


     Why SourceWare?

     Why do I include source code?  Why isn't the donation mandatory?  The value
     of good software should be self-evident.  The source code is the key to
     complete understanding of a program.  You can read it to find out how
     things are done.  You can also change it to suit your needs, so long as you
     do not distribute the modified version without my consent.


     Copyright

     If you modify this program, I would appreciate a copy of the new source
     code.   I am holding the copyright on the source code, so please don't
     delete my name from the program files or from the documentation.

          without limitation, any warranties of merchantability and/or
          fitness for a particular purpose.  I shall not be liable for any

          arising from a failure of this program to operate in the manner
          desired by the user.  I shall not be liable for any damage to
          data or property which may be caused directly or indirectly by
          the use of this program.

          IN NO EVENT WILL I BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING
          ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS OR OTHER INCIDENTAL OR
          CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE
          THE PROGRAM, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.


                                       SUPPORT

     I work very hard to produce a software package of the highest quality and
     functionality.  I try to look into all reported bugs, and will generally
     fix reported problems within a few days.

     Since this is user supported software under the SourceWare concept, I don't
     expect you to register if you don't like it or if it doesn't meet your
     needs.   

     If you have any questions, bugs, or suggestions, please contact me at:
                         Phone number         Modem type

                                       CREDITS

     I would like to personally thank all those who contributed in some way to
     the development of ProDoor.

     I thank Ward Christensen for creating XMODEM, the grandfather of all of
     today's PC communication protocols.  

     I thank Telenet for offering PC Pursuit, which created the need for the new
     protocols.


     ProDoor makes use of external protocol and driver programs.  I thank the
     authors of these protocol drivers for their work in advancing the state of
     the art in PC communications,  and for offering these programs to the
     public.
