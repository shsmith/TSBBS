Release notes for ProDoor 3.40                          03-31-91
==============================

ProDoor 3.4 is a major release fixing known bugs in ProDoor 3.3, adding
new features and improving performance.

This version includes a new manual, and requires some changes in data
and configuration files compared to prodoor 3.3.

Please read !PRODOOR.NEW for details on exactly what's been changed.


Installation
------------

The files supplied in PRODOR34.ZIP may be used to install ProDoor from
scratch, or to update an existing ProDoor 3.3 system to version 3.4.

The INSTALL program will replace all ProDoor files with the current
version.  Running INSTALL does *NOT* change your CONFINFO or EXTUSER
files, but it DOES replace your PROD.CNF file with a new copy.

All file formats of ProDoor 3.4 are still recognized; no file
conversions are required, though there are new features that will not be
activated without installation of the new files.

Please run the CONFIG program and verify all the prodoor configuration
options.  Some of the new options may need to be changed when upgrading
from ProDoor 3.3 or earlier.


Optional Files
--------------

ProDoor now includes an optional "overlay" version, which requires
30-40K less RAM during operation.  This version may be needed on some
multi-tasking systems during the SHELL for archive functions.  The only
change is the replacement of the normal PRODOOR.EXE file with the
overlay version of PRODOOR.EXE.  The overlay version of ProDoor 3.4 will
be posted as PROD34OV.ZIP.

The ProDoor 3.4 documentation has been prepared in Word Perfect 5.1
format.  If you have Word Perfect, you may prefer to download the WP5
version of the documentation so you can make a nicer looking manual
print out.  The Word Perfect version of the prodoor manual will be
posted as PROD34WP.ZIP.
