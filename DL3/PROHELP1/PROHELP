<A>bandon   Abandon (exit) the current conference and return to the
            Main Board.

            Since each conference has a separate File and Directory
            structure, Message Base, and possibly Bulletins, using
            this command defaults all of these to the Main Board.

            If you frequent several conferences, it is not necessary
            to <A>bandon each one.  You may <J>oin one conference
            from within another one.  This is easier to remember if
            you think of the Main Board as Conference 0, the default
            conference (which it is!)  No, you cannot <A>bandon the
            Main Board 컴 please refer to the <G>oodbye command.

<B>ulletin  Bulletin listings.  This describes (or lists) the available
            system bulletins, and optionally displays one of them.

            Syntax:  B        - Displays a list of available bulletins.
                     B 1      - Displays bulletin 1 on your screen.

            Each conference may have a unique set of bulletin listings.
            If a conference Does have unique bulletins, they are only
              viewable from within that particular conference.
            If a conference Does Not have unique bulletins (or if you
              are not currently in a conference), the bulletins of the
              Main Board are listed and/or displayed.

            If entering the <B> command alone, the next prompt asks you
            to enter a bulletin # to view.  You may also <R>elist those
            available or exit the bulletin system by pressing <Enter>.

<C>omment   Comment to the Sysop.  This allows you to send a private
            mail message (up to 99 lines) to the Sysop.  As this is
            a private message, it may only be viewed by the Sysop.

            This command is very similar to entering a mail message.
            Messages are entered via the full-screen Visual Editor.
            Visual Editor Help is available by pressing <CTRL>+<Z>.
            To exit the Visual Editor, simply press the <ESC> key.
            Upon exiting the Visual Editor, two available options
            are:

              <S>ave  the Message   (this is the typical response)
              <A>bort the Message   (mail message is not saved)

Advanced_Topic - Entering Message Files via ASCII Upload.

            If you have a lengthy message, you are a poor typist, or
            you pay exorbitant long distant fees, you can type up the
            Message File offline and enter it via ASCII Upload.

            To do this, enter the <C>omment command and message subject.
            After entering the Visual Editor, simply execute an ASCII
            Upload with your Telecomm package (<PgUp> if using Telix.)
            Exit the Visual Editor via <ESC> and <S>ave the Message.

            NOTES:  You may not use a Word Processor (Word Perfect,
                    etc.) to Type the Message File.  You MUST use a
                    standard ASCII Text Editor (I recommend Qedit.)
                    Also, be sure to place the file in your Upload
                    Directory as configured in your TeleComm Package.

:CD
:LIB
:ROM
@CLS@
(CD) ROM    This command allows you to access the CD ROM drive.  The
(LIB)       disk is identified as PC SIG (Special Interest Group)
(ROM)       version 9.0 which contains over 31,000 public domain &
            shareware programs.

            Example:
               CD
               CD 1234

            If the command CD is initiated all by itself, you will be
            prompted by a list of the CD ROM files & description of the
            files.  At any point, you can discontinue the listing &
            extract any number of the disk library which you like.

            If the second example (CD ####) is used, you will NOT be
            prompted with the description of files, yet the file will
            be extracted normally.
	@WAIT@
	@CLS@
$DEFAULT$
            There are 3 stages the LIBRARY file will go through:

               1 - Getting Extracted
               2 - Checked for Virus & Trojans
               3 - Stamped with Authenticity verification

            The extracted file will be stored in a TEMPORARY file 
            called CD-#### where #### is the number of the requested
            library.  This file will be erased, after your logoff from
            the BBS.

:CHAT
@CLS@

<CHAT>      This runs the ProDoor LIVE CHAT Door (program.)  This allows
            you to CHAT with other users of this system.  Chatting on
            this system requires a minimum security level of 50.

<CHAT-NO>   Makes you unavailable for chat requests by other nodes.

<CHAT-YES>  Makes you available for chat requests by other nodes.
            NOTE: Since the default is "available for chat", you will
                  never need to enter CHAT-YES unless you previously
                  made yourself "unavailable for chat" via CHAT-NO.

<CHAT-?>    Reports if you are currently available for chat requests.

<D>ownload  Downloading transfers file(s) from the BBS System to your
            computer system.

            If you wish to download several files, I suggest entering
            <D> with no parameters.  If you just wish to download one or
            two files, you may pass the file names and "stack" either
            file command <S>tart or command <G>oodbye to immediately
            begin the transfer.  If you use <S> or <G> in this manner,
            the system uses Zmodem as the file tranfer protocol.

            If not otherwise entered, a .ZIP file extension is assumed.

<E>nter     Enter a new mail message, either public or private.

            The system prompts you for the recipient of the message.
            If you specify a user's name, you have the option to make
            the message private (only may be read by the recipient.)
            If you wish to leave a public message, you may specify
            "ALL" as the intended recipient of the message.
            In either case, the system also prompts you to enter the
            'subject' (or title) of the mail message.

            PLEASE REMEMBER that each conference has a separate message
            base.  Place each mail message in the appropriate conference.

            All files displayed are available for you to download.
            Please also use the <F> command to avoid file duplication
            prior to uploading a file.  To best utilize your time on
            the system, it's a good idea to make a list of the files

            Flagged Files are automatically selected when entering <D>.
            Wild cards are allowed and an extension of .Zip is assumed.

            Syntax:  FL fname      to FLag file "fname.zip"

            This is one of those features that you either "Love" or
            you "Hate."  The Sysop "HATES" it.  If you aren't familiar
            with ProDoor commands, I highly recommend NOT enabling the
            HOtkey feature.  If you are HOT on this feature, a good
            time to enable it is after you feel comfortable in <X>pert
            mode (no main menu displayed.)  For this reason, I have
            restricted its use to security level 50 and above.

     NOTES: Some commands do not function properly in this mode.  Trying
              to enter <CHAT-NO> dumps you right into the <CHAT> channel
              and <FL>ag Files gives you a <F>ile Directory.  Cool, huh?
            In HOtkey mode you should use ";" (not SPACE) to "stack" any
              ProDoor commands such as "J;S".  This is due to the fact
              that the Spacebar functions just like the <ENTER> key.

<M>ode      This toggles the Graphics display mode either On or Off.
            The Graphics display requires support of standard IBM (ANSI)
            Color Graphics.  The use of Graphics Mode greatly enhances
            the use of any BBS system since important words, phrases,
            commands, file names, etc., are emphasized with color.
            Besides, Sysops spend a great deal of time colorizing their
            BBS for both ease-of-use and your enjoyment.

            The Graphics Mode is also selectable each time you log onto
            the BBS.  It is the first question you are asked at logon.

(O)perator  This command allows you to "page" the Sysop of the BBS.

            Since the Sysop is a "busy guy" as well as a "night owl",
            he is rarely on the BBS during "normal" hours.  If you
            don't see him via the Node Command, it is futile to page.
            Please leave a <C>omment to the Sysop.

            Actually, this command has been superseded by the Chat
            feature of ProDoor.  The "old" method of chatting was

            You may specify either a door number or a door name as
            a parameter.  If you specify neither, a list of available
            Doors is displayed.

            Upon logon to this BBS, you automatically Open Door 1.
            Door 1 is allocated to ProDoor.

            "header" and the first 72 characters of message text.

<QQ>uicker  Displays a Quicker summary of the mail messages which are
            available for reading (displays only the message header.)

            These commands have nothing to do with the speed messages
            are displayed 컴 this is based solely upon your modem.
            If you wish to "capture" or "log" some messages, examine
            the <NS> Non-Stop feature, BUT be careful to select a
            reasonable range or you may find yourself very short on
            disk space and very long on phone bill.

:REPACK
@CLS@

<REPACK>    Repacks the Zip File into an alternate compressed file
            format.  The "new" file is stored in the file $SCRATCH$.
            Since files are stored in Zip Format, you really should
            download the latest version of PKZIP from Directory 1 of
            the Main Board.  This saves you both time and money.

            You can specify an alternate compression format:

              REPACK TPC14 LZH       - convert TPC14.Zip to .LZH
              REPACK PRODOR30 ZOO    - convert PRODOR30.Zip to .ZOO

            next logon, you can Reply to any messages you received
            without having to read them again.

            You may pass the mail message number you wish to respond
            to as a parameter.

:X
@CLS@

<X>pert     This command toggles Xpert mode either On or Off.

            Expert mode ON merely means that the Main Menu is not
            displayed after each command or command sequence.  This
            is a preferred mode of operation (especially for 2400
            baud callers) merely because it saves you time.

            Expert mode is one of the parameters which is saved for
            each user, therefore if you logged off in Xpert Mode, you
            will enter the system in Xpert mode upon your next logon.

            Don't panic if you find yourself in Xpert Mode.  Simply
            enter <X> again or <?> and the Main Menu will appear.
