PROTRNS replaces original Sam Smith's PROTRNS file distributed with 
ProDoor 3.x files.  To implement, just copy this file OVER the 
original PROTRNS which might be found in d:\PROD directory (where d: 
is the driver letter.)

If you have no idea what this file does, STOP...  This file is NOT FOR 
YOU.

Due to memory limitation of ProDoor allowance for PROTRNS, you might 
find yourself in a small "bind" as I did.  I noticed that my DOWNLOAD 
or UPLOAD batch files were aborting.  This is due to the RAM left in 
ProDoor to keep track of the DRIVE:\PATH\FILENAME.EXT & when:

a) batch file transfer is issued
b) more than 1 or 2 files are selected
c) long path/file names are involved (G:\PCB\MAIN_UPL\FILENAME.EXT)

 ... The system simply gives as much information as it could remember
 & aborts the rest of the batch transfer.

I must tell you that the above case strictly depends on the available 
RAM on your system & there is no way that I can assure you of this 
occurrence.

Solution
--------
I simply switched to Sam's OVERLAY version of ProDoor & all my 
problems went away.  Overlay version of ProDoor can be downloaded from 
"The ToolShop BBS, Home of ProDoor/HSLINK" or any other quality BBS.

Also, with the amount of RAM left for conventional use under MS DOS 5.00
using a 286 or higher system, you might find yourself free of any memory
limitation.  The best way of testing this process is to load PRODOOR
locally & then (F5) shell to DOS & execute the MEM command.  Make sure
that there is sufficient amount of memory left for loading DSZ or HSLINK
(usually about 60k) & the file pathnames.  My rule of thumb is 60k x 3
or 180k of free RAM.

There are a few places in this file where the name "COM2: BBS" or 
"COM2: Remote BBS" are mentioned.  Please replace this with your BBS's 
name.

Should you add or modify this file, please upload it to the above BBS, 
so we all can have a universal version of PROTRNS.  I call this version
PROTRNS4.ZIP  Please see that the next version would have a different
rev. number.

Disclaimer
----------
Use at your own risk.  Please make a backup copy or your original PROTRNS
file.
