Syntax:  MV2CALL SOURCE.FIL CALLER
         SOURCE.FIL is the file that will be copied from
         CALLER is a 64 character/line file holding a PCB style caller log

Mv2Call is a program that copies a file to the caller log.  After the
copying, the file is deleted.  Two version exist in the archive:
   MV2CALL.EXE--process lines that are greater than 62 character of text
     into multiple lines to copy to the CALLER file.
   MV2CALL.COM--truncates lines that are greater than 62 charters long
Install the version that you need.  The EXE is obviously larger but so
what... if you need the feature.
