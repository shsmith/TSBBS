                        =======================

The EXTLIST program lists a summary of the contents of the extended user
file.  It uses the EXTUSER environment variable to determine the full
filename of the extended user file.  If the EXTUSER environment is not
set the program will access 'EXTUSER' in the default directory.


Here is a typical display:

      20 extended conferences in file.
