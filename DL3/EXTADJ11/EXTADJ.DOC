ProDoor automatically initialized the extended user file, EXTUSER, for
up to 90 extended conferences.  The EXTADJ.EXE program allows you to
adjust the number of conferences allocated in the user file.

ProDoor supports any number of extended conferences between 0 and 2000.
A setting of 0 gives the 40 standard message areas, while a setting of
2000 gives 2040 total message areas.

NOTE: Versions of ProDoor (and compatible utilities) dated 3-9-90 and
before support only 215 extended conferences.  Make sure you have a
program version dated 3-10-90 or later before allocating more than 215
extended conference areas!

The EXTADJ program uses the EXTUSER environment variable to determine
the full filename of the extended user file.  If the EXTUSER environment
is not set the program will access 'EXTUSER' in the default directory.

After running the original extended user file will be saved with the
last character of the filename changed to '&'.  You can delete this
backup file once you are sure the conversion was successful.


Here is a typical display:

      EXTADJ 1.1:  Adjust Extended Conference Allocation in EXTUSER File
      Copyright 1988, 1990 Samuel H. Smith

      Extended user file: EXTUSER
         90 extended conferences in file.
        569 bytes per user record.
        219 user records in file.

      File is currently allocated for 90 extended conferences.
      Enter new number of extended conferences in file: 750

        750 extended conferences in new file.
       3869 bytes per user record.

      Working ...
        220 records converted.

      Conversion completed.

In this example the number of extended conferences is increased from the
standard 90 to new limit of 750 conferences.
