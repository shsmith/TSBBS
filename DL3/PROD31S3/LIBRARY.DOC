ProDoor supports a 'LIB' command for access to a CD-ROM library disk.


To install this feature you need these files:

\PROD\LIBDEF
   -- Library disk definition file.  This file lists the cd-rom
      directory prefix for each range of disk codes.  Change "E:" to
      whatever drive letter you use to access the CD-ROM.

   Example:
      ;prodoor definition file for cd-rom library
      ;file format:  <hi disk code> <cd-rom prefix for codes upto hicode>
      ;              no leading or extra spaces allowed.
      ;                       modified for PC-SIG 4-88 high-sierra format
      9 E:\001_100\disk000
      99 E:\001_100\disk00
      100 E:\001_100\disk0
      200 E:\101_200\disk0
      300 E:\201_300\disk0
      400 E:\301_400\disk0
      500 E:\401_500\disk0
      600 E:\501_600\disk0
      700 E:\601_700\disk0
      800 E:\701_800\disk0
      900 E:\801_900\disk0
      999 E:\901_1000\DISK0
      1000 E:\901_1000\disk


\PROD\PROLIB
   -- Menu of library disks.  You can either list all library disks
      here, or make this short and put the library disk table
      into a DIR file.

  Example:
         Library disks available on CD-ROM:
         Disk                Description
         ----  ------------------------------------------
         0001  Game Series No 1
         0002  Spoolers
         0003  RATBAS
         0004  DBMS/Modem7
         0005  PC-FILE Plus Disk 1 of 2


\PROD\PROLIB.BAT
   -- This batch file is called by prodoor to process each library
      request.  It is called with parameters specifying the subdirectory
      on the CD-ROM (as listed in the LIBDEF file) and the zipfile to create.
      You can edit this file to call up PKZIP, PKPAK, etc. to physically
      access the CD-ROM.

   Example:
      echo off
      rem. process library disk request - for ProDOOR 2.9
      rem.   %1-logfile  %2-subdir on cd-rom  %3-disk on cd-rom  %4-scratchdir
      pkZIP %4\CD-%3 %2\*.* >%1
      echo. >>%1 Disk %3 is now stored in CD-%3.ARC for you!


\PROD\LIBHELP
   -- This help message is printed just before PROLIB.BAT is called.  It
      should explain to the user where to look for the cd-rom library
      files.


The library function can be called up from the prodoor main command
prompt by typing 'LIB' (for LIBrary disk).
