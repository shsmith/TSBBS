                        ADJUST EXTENDED USER FILE          12-28-88
                        =========================

ProDoor automatically initialized the extended user file, EXTUSER, for
up to 90 extended conferences.  The EXTADJ.EXE program allows you to
adjust the number of conferences allocated in the user file.

ProDoor supports any number of extended conferences between 0 and 215.
A setting of 0 gives the 40 standard message areas, while a setting of
215 gives 255 total message areas.

The EXTADJ program uses the EXTUSER environment variable to determine
the full filename of the extended user file.  If the EXTUSER environment
is not set the program will access 'EXTUSER' in the default directory.

After running the original extended user file will be saved with the
last character of the filename changed to '&'.  You can delete this
backup file once you are sure the conversion was successful.


Here is a typical display:

      Extended User File:  Extended Conference Allocation Adjustment
      Copyright 1988 Samuel H. Smith

         90 extended conferences in file.
        569 bytes per user record.
        469 user records in file.

      File is currently allocated for 90 extended conferences.
      Enter new number of extended conferences in file: 20

         20 extended conferences in new file.
        219 bytes per user record.

      Conversion completed.

In this example the number of extended conferences is reduced from the
standard 90 to a more economical 20, taking less than half the disk
space of the original file.
