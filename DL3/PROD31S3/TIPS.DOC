ProKit Door Writing Tips                                (C) 1988 S.H.Smith
------------------------                                ProKit 2.8, 8/4/88

+  Do all output with DISP, DISPLN and NEWLINE functions.

+  Do NOT use Borland's CRT unit.  The CRT unit will lock up in some
   multi-task systems, and does not communicate.

+  Use one of the provided input functions to read from the user
      GET_CMDLINE   - for command lines
      INPUT         - for lines with length limits
      GET_KEY       - for single characters (no echo)

+  Use the supplied functions to select one of the seven basic colors
      RED, GREEN, BLUE, CYAN, MAGENTA, WHITE, GRAY.
   These can be used at any time (even in non-graphic mode).

+  Use these functions ONLY when in GRAPHICS mode:
      POSITION(x,y);
      CLEAR_SCREEN;
      CLEAR_EOL;

+  Check the GRAPHICS flag before sending any ANSI codes to the user;
   some users won't accept ansi codes.

+  Check the DUMP_USER flag in all major program loops.  This flag is set
   if the user hangs up, his time runs out, or if the sysop wants to dump
   the caller out of the door.

+  Always call UNINIT before calling HALT to terminate a door program.  
   Otherwise the dangling interrupt handlers will crash the system.

+  The first line of a ProKit config files must be the com driver type.
   This can be one of:
      INTERRUPT         ;the best, fastest
      BIOS              ;if interrupts fail to work
      PCBTRAP           ;BIOS with special screen management for PCBTRAP.
   Your door program is free to re-open the config file and read additional
   information from it.

+  ProKit based doors can be tested with a special "local sysop" mode of
   operation.  In this mode, you need not load PCBoard to run the door.
   This option is selected by adding 'LOCAL' to the end of the door
   command line.  For example:
      prokit prokit.cnf \pcb2 LOCAL
   will run the ProKit demo door in sysop-local mode directly from DOS.

+  The standard DOOR script for ProKit doors has this format:
      echo off
      cd \pro
      prokit prokit.cnf c:\pcb2
      cd \pcb2
      if exist event.bat event               <<<--- take note
      board
   Notice line 5.  This line will start your timed event if needed.  Any
   door that can logoff a user (during carrier loss or with goodbye) has
   the possibility of starting the event.

+  The F5 (shell to DOS) function will only work if you leave enough 
   free ram for a new copy of COMMAND.COM to be loaded.  To do this, you
   need to include this directive in your main program:
      {$M 12000,40000,40000}  {Stack, minheap, maxheap}
   Adjust the values to your needs, but limit the MAXHEAP setting to the
   smallest value that is needed.  This leaves the rest of memory available
   for the shell.

+  Take a look at the sample door - PROKIT.PAS - it has examples of how
   to use many of ProKit's features.

+  Call the function load_cnames_file during your door initialization if
   you are going to access the conf_info data structure.  This is no
   longer automatically loaded, speeding up doors that have no interest
   in this data.
