History of PCB/ProDOOR changes (in reverse order)
-------------------------------------------------

28-Sep-89
   Changes to prevent users selecting a password with more than one word.

25-Sep-89
   Final assembly of production-style beta archive.  Please test the
   INSTALL procedure and report back with any problems.
   Updated documentation and supporting files.

22-Sep-89
   (NS)non-stop command wasn't working at mail command prompts.

   Documentation update.  Please report any major bugs that remain in
   the beta code.  Production release is scheduled in early october.

   Added new environment variable
        SET EXTCONF=ON
   to allow ProDoor and other Pro* doors to remain in extended
   conferences after exit to DOS.  Current versions of PCBOARD 14.2 will
   abort back to BOARD.BAT when this happens, but ProLogon and other
   pro* doors support this.

17-Sep-89
   'NS' command wasn't working at Mail Command prompts (broken 16-sep).

16-Sep-89
   Default "Mail" commands were broken by the 14-sep beta.

   @ variables were not being expanded in Quick scan displays.

   Changes in low-level interrupt handlers to address problem of
   repeated or lost input characters.

14-Sep-89
   Added command translation (via PROMAIL.XLT) at Mail Command prompt.

   Disabled hotkey modes in ProKit doors.

   prevented aborting the operation after 5 tries.

   Presence of EGA and 43/50 line video modes is now disabled by the
   'SET OVCRT=ON' environment.  This may solve the "background init"
   problem under TaskView.

10-Sep-89
   Added error report when overlay or EXE file cannot be opened.

   Added a check for 'SET OVCRT=ON' to disable quick BIOS functions,
   since these seem to interfere with OmniView/TaskView operation.

29-Aug-89
   Corrected "warning: automatic disconnect" message (broken 27-aug).

   PROMAIN.XLT command translation file.

   Printer logging was not working in some 8/19 and 8/20 betas.

19-Aug-89
   Corrected an error in handling a missing PROMAIN.XLT file.

   Changed printer output code to use BIOS rather than DOS, greatly
   speeding printing through a network.

   The ALT-P function now automatically disables graphics mode to
   prevent sending escape codes to the printer.

17-Aug-89

13-Aug-89
   Changed (baudG) to (baudE) when indicating error correcting corrections.

   The "node dropping to DOS" status code (X) will now be preserved in
   the usernet file when the node status would normally change.

   Early 13-aug betas did not update USERNET.DAT properly.

12-Aug-89
   Corrected strange display on return from F5(shell) while in chat
   (broken in 10-aug beta).

   Control-K was not properly repeating command prompts.

   Changes in critical error handler to allow FATAL to handle critical
   errors when loaded.

   Adjusted buffering for faster text file displays through a network.

   longer needed; please delete it.

10-Aug-89
   Added expiration-date to (F)ind-user display.

   Deleted automatic news displays in ProEdit.

   The join speedup of 6-aug prevented joining conferences that
   have a number in the name.

   Inserted I/O delays between I/O port accesses to prevent
   problems on very fast CPUs.

   Changed (J +) and (J -) commands to use AutoJoin flags.
   Changes in (J n) for faster operation.

05-Aug-89

   Added F4 [find] function to Conference Definition section of
   PROSM config program.

   Added messages in Extended User Edit function to indicate the reason
   for skipping a user record.  Messages are:
        [FLAGS]         ;user.flags not initialized (still = ' ')
        [NAME]          ;specified extuser record has wrong name
   ProSM cannot edit a user record that does not have a corresponding
   EXTUSER record as created by PRODOOR.   See PRODOOR.DOC and PROSM.DOC
   for file conventions that are required.

   Added F2 [edit] / F3 [edit graphics] functions for file editing while
   in Conference Definitions section.  Use SET EDITOR=PROGRAM to change
   text editors.

   during LOCAL sessions.

   Corrected counting of conferences when a new CONFINFO file is created
   during the same session.

   either ALT-P or (F3) is used to do printer logging.

   Worked on (RE) right after an auto-join suggestion.

   Corrected current message when 'RE' is used after 'autojoin' is
   suggested.

   Updated PRONS module to allow number of scrolling lines to be
   specified on the command line.

30-Jul-89
   Changed 'z' keyword prompt to allow multi-word file search keys
   *if* the keyword is not stacked.

   Upload processing was not detecting files with the same name but
   different file .EXTs as it should.

   Changes in PROSM to allow security control over prodoor's new (W)rite-
   user-info command.

   Added new (ED)it-header command to allow direct message header edits
   without first entering the (MOD) function.  Stacking is allowed, so you
   can use commands like this:
        ED F SYSOP              ;change "from:" to SYSOP
        ED E                    ;toggle echo status
        ED S NEW SUBJECT        ;change subject

   Corrected TS command prompts to match the Z command.

27-Jul-89
   The new thread logic was accidentally being activated during a Y scan.

   'TO:' and 'SUBJECT:' edits in the (MOD) function were not being
   updated on the screen, though they were stored in the message file.

   Added (W)rite-user-info command in main command prompt.

26-Jul-89
   Added logic to prevent multiple "chat request" messages.

   Added logic to delay chat request checks by the 'node chat delay'
   setting in PCBsetup.

   Added a flag in EXTUSER file to lock a user's current conference
   registrations, allowing sysop to block access to public or auto-
   register areas.

   Updated PROSM to include the new "Lock Conferences: Y/N" flag in the
   extended user data section.  Set this flag to YES and the user will
   forever be barred from any conference not explicitly selected through
   this screen.

   Added support for non-standard COM port configurations.  To use
   com ports other than the normal COM1 and COM2, you can now insert the
   following statements in your BOARD.BAT file:
        SET COMBASE=nnnn        ;port base I/O address (decimal)
        SET COMIRQ=n            ;port IRQ setting
   Use these SET statements in conjunction with a com port setting of
   COM3 in your PCBOARD.DAT file.

   Mail packets were not being deleted immediately after a successful
   download.

   Increased detail in DOS error reports.

24-Jul-89
   Added a check for chat requests from other nodes.  When a chat
   request is received, the message
        (USER NAME) on node (NN) wants to CHAT with you.
   is printed and the contents of PROREQ is then displayed.  Edit the
   PROREQ file to provide instructions for how to return to PCBoard to
   initiate a chat session.

   Enabled command stacking in (MOD) function, allowing things
   like (H;T;whoto) to be entered on a single line.

   (C)omment messages are now assigned a status code of (~) rather
   than (*) for better PCBoard compatibility.

   Generate automatic disconnect after 10 invalid responses to a
   yes/no question.

   In batch uploading, once a filespec is entered the transfer will
   be aborted if no valid filespecs are given (the code used to
   go into unspecified upload mode under these conditions).

   instead of the hardcoded 'Automatic disconnect!' message.

   Updated PRO-P.BAT to properly repack in ZOO format when member files
   do not have a period in the file names.

   Updated PROUTEST.BAT to eliminate "perm" dszlog creating.  This was
   causing "file creation error" on several systems.

   Added buffering to CONFINFO accesses to speed (J)oin command.

   Added a message display when conference bulletins are updated
   since the last call.

19-Jul-89
   Wrote new assembly routines to speed most displays by up to 50%.
   Corrected 'to:' display during message entry.

   Added automatic support for 43 line EGA local display.  Note: you
   must switch the display into 43 line mode before calling ProDoor.
   The SET43.COM program in ANSI_43.ZIP seems to work on most EGA
   display adaptors.  (NOTE: SET LINES=43 IS NO LONGER USED)
   Updated visual editor to automatically adjust to user page length
   and screen lines.
   Updated PRONS.COM module to automatically adjust to number of
   screen lines in use.
   Some file paths were being shown on the screen when the directory
   did not begin with a drive letter.
   Corrected handling of replies to 'TO: @user@' messages.

   current message number is returned to the message following the start
   of the thread.

   make function keys work better in visual editor over buffered modems.
   Corrected upload description posting when SET NOULBY=ON is used.

11-Jul-89
   Initial "free download" message was sometimes including the
   directory of the matching file.

   Decreased heap and stack allocation by 2k.
   The PRODOOR.OVR file is now expected in the SAME directory as the
   active copy of PRODOOR.EXE (the .OVR file used to be required in the
   current directory). This allows you to relocate PRODOOR.EXE and
   PRODOOR.OVR to a RAMDISK.

09-Jul-89
   Added a message before starting "free" downloads.
   New versions of CHKPATH.EXE and PRO-R.BAT automatically delete
   original ZIPM file when repacking to a new format.

   Upload duplication checks now ignore the file extention.
   Upload descriptions now include the name of the uploader.

07-Jul-89
   Packed prodoor.exe to increase heap space.  If you ran out of heap
   with yesterday's beta, please use ALT-B and report back the two
   numbers that are printed out.  These numbers tell me how much heap
   and stack are needed on your system configuration.
   Added another error check when processing ALT-I.
   Event suspense time was not being handled properly for events
   between 6pm and midnight.

06-Jul-89

   ProDoor's own internal flag.
   Changed (FL U) command to allow specific flags to be removed.
   Use the new (FL U *) command to clear all flags.

   Added code in PROSM to automatically adjust .NDX file sizes to match
   the specified number of blocks.  You don't even need to repack /
   reindex conference files!
   Time adjustment was not working properly in CHAT mode (idle time factor
   was being used instead of chat mode time factor).

09-May-89
   Added optional 'starting conference' parameter to (J A) command.

08-May-89

   a 'city:' display was present.
   Files listed in PROFREE are not exempt from daily byte limit checks
   prior to the downloading.

   Added a check for expired users.  When a user is expired the 'expired
   security level' will be used in all security checks.  Please note,
   however, that prodoor does not yet check the 'expired conference
   registration' settings - expired users are given normal conference
   access.

23-Apr-89
   Softened "P" to allow REPACK command in hotkeys mode.
   Updated PRO-V.BAT to lock out textview of this form with LHARC10 -
   Please use LZHTV in your PRO-R.BAT file instead.
   Starting line number for quotations automatically selects line 8 if a
   'city:' line is present.
   Added support for conference-specific message files.  Append .NNN
   (where NNN is the conference number) to message file names for
   conference-specific files.  If *.NNN files are not found, the normal
   message files will be used instead.  Note: this feature is not
   available when alternate language .LNG files are being used.
   The (J S/N/Y) commands were not working when the last-read pointer
   was lower than the first message on file.

   uploads.  Please install the new PROUTEST.BAT file.

20-Apr-89
   The (X)tract function now changes the SCRATCH file .EXT to match that
   of the source file, instead of using the "assumed" file type.
   The (H)otkey command wasn't working (broken in 4-17 beta).
   Several changes in PRO-*.BAT files to improve error checking and
   reporting.

18-Apr-89
   Corrected cases when '*.*' is used in a download command line
   and files were flagged as 'uploads'.

17-Apr-89
   Corrected spurious error messages when download.txt is undefined.

         will need copies of the following programs available to the
         batch files:

        PROGRAM                         FOUND IN
    --------------                  ----------------
    ZIPDS.EXE                       zipds11.zip
    ZIPTV.EXE ARCTV.EXE             ziptv15.zip arctv29b.zip
    PROXZIP.EXE PROXARC.EXE         prodor29.zip prodor28.zip
    PKZIP.EXE PKUNZIP.EXE           pkz092.exe

    PAK.EXE                         pak151.exe
    LHARC.EXE                       lharc10.com

         ";" to stack a command, you will cancel hotkeys for the rest of
         that line.  For example:
                J 1
         will launch the Join as soon as you type <space>, whereas
                J;1
