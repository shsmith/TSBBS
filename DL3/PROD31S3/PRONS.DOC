The first time you run ProNS, it becomes resident and freezes the top
half of the screen.   From then on, any program that writes to the screen
via DOS or BIOS or ANSI will be restricted to the bottom of the screen.

The second time you run ProNS, it will be removed from memory, restoring
the screen to normal.

ProNS was originally written for use by ProDOOR, but can be used in other
applications where the screen needs to be protected from scrolling.

This program works under TaskView and other environments that do
not pass DOS or ANSI outputs to BIOS.


Revision History
----------------

7-14-88
        Changed tick counting logic to check BIOS tick counter.  This will
prevent the clock from running slow due to "lost" clock interrupts (as
happens under DesqView and other multi taskers).

1-20-89
        Deleted the com port and timer monitoring logic.  ProNS now has
the single function of keeping the top of the screen from scrolling away.

7-18-89
        Updated to automatically detect 43 line screen modes and manage
the screen accordingly.
