   The only way we could get these programs to run AT ALL was to put
them in front of ProLogon in the BOARD.BAT.  That caused yet ANOTHER
problem ... every time the Board.bat cycled, even between doors, all
these programs were being run.  The programs worked correctly, but
our concern is the additional, unnecessary time to recycle.

   Our solution was to make a single change to your RECYCLE source
and change the BOARD.bat so that those programs will ONLY be run
between callers.  We took part of your advice to Ray Waltz and us
to make a change to our programs (but we don't even want them to
be CALLED unless the caller's offline) by having them look at the
PCBOARD.SYS to see if it's empty, a step further and changed
your recycle to reflect an errorlevel of 2 if the PCBOARD.SYS is
empty.  We grouped all our between-caller programs into a label
(:maint) and placed it just prior to :runpcb and inserted the line
        IF ERRORLEVEL 2 GOTO MAINT
just prior to the existing line; if errorlevel 1 goto runpcb.

   Now all works well and we're not cluttering up EVERY recycle of
the board.bat.  We've uploaded our board.bat and the altered source
of your RECYCLE in a file called RERECYCLE.zip, if you care to peek.

Wow! I'm long-winded tonight!  Thanks for listening, Sam!
