Upload Reward is a utility program to generate a bulletin of your best
uploaders, and optionally assign them to special security levels.

Features:

        *       Can reward users in multiple security levels and later
                return them to the original levels

        *       Correctly handles expired users, automatically updating
                the expired user levels rather than un-expired levels.

        *       Full sysop control over report header and footer text

        *       Generates detailed execution log

        *       Network compatible (I still recommend running the update
                only when all nodes are offline)

        *       Uses advanced buffering for quick execution

        *       Multiple configuration files may be used.  Use this in
                conjunction with multiple events to vary rewards
                according to "prime time" or other criteria you
                determine.


Usage:
   reward CONFIGFILE

Where:
   CONFIGFILE specifies the configuration file to be used.


Sample configuration file: REWARD.CNF
=====================================

   REWARD.HDR
   REWARD.TLR
   \PCB\GEN\BLT99
   REWARD.LOG
   \PCB\MAIN\USERS
   40
   4
   10 11
   50 51
   60 61
   70 71

   ----------------------------------
   Reward Configuration File Format:

   line 1 = Report header text file name (NUL if none)

   line 2 = Report trailer text file name (NUL if none)

   line 3 = Report bulletin output file name (NUL if none)

   line 4 = Reward activity log output file name (NUL if none)

   line 5 = Full pathname of USERS file

   line 6 = Number of users to reward

   line 7 = Number of security level table entries

   line 8 = First security table entry

   Security table entries are in the format
      NORMAL BONUS
   where
      NORMAL is the normal user level and
      BONUS is the level assigned to reward a top uploader.

   SourceWare: What is it?
   -----------------------

   SourceWare is my name for a unique concept in user supported
   software.

   Programs distributed under the SourceWare concept always include
   complete source code.

   This package can be freely distributed so long as it is not modified
   or sold for profit.  If you find that this program is valuable,  you
   can send me a donation for what you think it is worth.  I suggest
   about $10.

   Send your contributions to:
      Samuel H. Smith
      P.O. Box 4808
      Panorama City CA 91412-4808


   Why SourceWare?
   ---------------

   Why do I include source code?  Why isn't the donation manditory?  The
   value of good software should be self-evident. The source code is the
   key to complete understanding of a program.  You can read it to find
   out how things are done.  You can also change it to suit your needs,
   so long as you do not distribute the modified version without my
   consent.


   Copyright
   ---------

   If you modify this program, I would appreciate a copy of the new
   source code.   I am holding the copyright on the source code, so
   please don't delete my name from the program files or from the
   documentation.



DISCLAIMER
==========

I cannot be responsible for any damages resulting from the use or misuse
of this program!

IN NO EVENT WILL I BE  LIABLE TO  YOU FOR  ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING  ANY
LOST  PROFITS,  LOST  SAVINGS  OR OTHER INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OR  INABILITY TO  USE THE PROGRAM, OR
FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.



REVISION HISTORY
================

   13-Mar-92   1.2    Added user level to report.

   05-Mar-92   1.1    Added logic to check and update the "expired"
                      security level on users who are "expired"
                      according to the expiration date field of the user
                      record.  Also removed the need for a "sorting"
                      procedure for much quicker execution.

   17-Sep-89   1.0    Initial coding.  I wrote it because I wanted to
                      allow my best uploaders to access the
                      "subscription" lines of the Tool Shop BBS.  I
                      couldn't find any other utility with the
                      flexibility I needed.

SUPPORT
=======

   I work very hard to produce a software package of the highest quality
   and functionality.  I try to look into all reported bugs, and will
   generally fix reported problems within a few days.

   Since this is user supported software under the SourceWare concept, I
   don't expect you to contribute if you don't like it or if it doesn't
   meet your needs.

   If you have any questions, bugs, or suggestions, please contact me
   at:
       The Tool Shop BBS
        (818) 891-6780

   The latest version is always available for downloading.

   Enjoy!     Samuel H. Smith
