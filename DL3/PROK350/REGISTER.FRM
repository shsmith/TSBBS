                    PRODOOR/PROLOGON UTILITY REGISTRATION
                    =====================================

   Development of the ProDoor/ProLogon project was officially discontinued on
   7/13/91.  As of that date, registrations for ProDoor and ProLogon are no
   longer being accepted.  ProDoor and ProLogon are still in use on The Tool
   Shop and will be updated as needed for continued operation, but feature
   development and official product support are no longer available.

   If you wish to register ProDoor or ProLogon in your name, you can do so by
   purchasing a 1 year subscription to the Tool Shop BBS for $20.  Once you
   are a subscriber, you will be allowed to join conference 60 [BOOSTERS] and
   download a special utility that inserts your own personal registration
   message into the ProLogon program.

   Tool Shop subscribers are allowed 60 minutes per day and are not required
   to maintain an upload/download ratio.  Basic Tool Shop BBS subscriptions
   cost $20 per year.

   Online Credit Card subscription orders are now accepted.  Type 'ORDER' to
   access the online order facility.

   If you prefer to subscribe by mail, The Tool Shop mailing address is:
            Samuel H. Smith

   Please include your current USER NAME and PASSWORD so I can verify that
   the credit is applied to the correct user record.  THANKS!
