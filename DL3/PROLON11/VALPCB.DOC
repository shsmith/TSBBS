        The new VALPCB program validates that you have a valid copy
        of PCBOARD.EXE on your system.  This is required for operation
        of ProLogon version 1.0.

        Run this program from your ProLogon directory.
        It creates the file PROLON.REG, which must be in the current
        directory whenever PROLON.EXE is executed.

        When you register your copy of ProLogon you will be allowed to
        download the REGLON program, which removes the "[UNREGISTERED]"
        message and allows you insert your own custom registration
        message into the door.
