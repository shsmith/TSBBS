You will now select the files to be mailed to you.  You can select
any number of files, but each file must be able to fit entirely on
a disk of the selected size.  Wildcards are allowed.

You can also access file listings by pressing F, or search for files by
pressing L (by name), Z (by keyword) or N (by date).

Press <ENTER> when finished selecting files.
