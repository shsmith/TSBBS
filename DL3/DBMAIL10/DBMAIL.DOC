     IN NO EVENT WILL I BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
     LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS OR OTHER INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
     DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM, OR
     FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.


                                Overview
                                --------

This program is a PCBoard-compatible DOOR designed to let your callers
order "downloads by mail" with payment by credit card.  It can also be
used locally for order entry.

The DBMAIL door presents the user with a menu of supported disk formats
that can be mailed.  The user can then select specific files from your
file system.  The door will automatically figure determine the number of
diskettes required and will calculate the final price of the order.
State and local tax will be added, if needed.

All files normally available in the current conference will
automatically be located, and any FSEC security measures will be
enforces (with the exception of file and byte limits).  Users are also
allowed to access the dir listings with the normal F, L, Z and N
commands.

The user is then asked for billing information, including shipping
address and credit card numbers.  Credit card numbers are checksum
verified.  It is possible to configure the door to accept only certain
credit card types, and to assign a different 'company' name for each
type of credit card.


                              Installation
                              ------------

Sample doorfile for the DBMAIL door:

\pcb\order
----------
   echo off
   rem. Pcboard door script for DOWLOADS BY MAIL program
   u:
   cd \pcb\dbmail
   dbmail dbmail.cnf %PCBDRIVE%%PCBDIR%
   %PCBDRIVE%
   cd %PCBDIR%
   if exist event.bat event
   board

This doorfile assumes that DBMAIL.EXE and the associated data files are
stored in u:\pcb\dbmail.  Change references to this directory if you
install the DBMAIL DOOR somewhere else.

To access the DBMAIL door locally, you can use a batch file like this:

\pcb\lmail.bat
---------------
   @echo off
   if not '%PCBDRIVE%' == '' goto online
   set PCBDRIVE=J:
   set PCBDIR=\pcb3
   :online
   u:
   cd \pcb\dbmail
   dbmail lmail.cnf %PCBDRIVE%%PCBDIR% LOCAL
   %PCBDRIVE%
   cd %PCBDIR%

This batch file will use the current PCBOARD node information, if
present in the environment.  Otherwise it uses J:\PCB3 as the node
directory.  Change lines 3 and 4 to reflect your own local
configuration.  The alternate 'lmail.cnf' configuration file may include
ordering options that are not provided to remote callers.


                          Configuration files
                          -------------------

The DBMAIL program uses a configuration file to define supported disk
formats as well as the various text files which are displayed to the
user.

Sample configuration file for the DBMAIL door:

u:\pcb\dbmail\dbmail.cnf

                (list of digits: 2=carte blanche 3=amex 4=visa 5=mc 6=discover)
   Line 3: The company name for (placed in $4$ for display purposes) for
           the first entry in the credit card type list.
           The company names for each additional entry in card type list
   Line 4: The state name for in-state tax

           state tax is collected)

   Line 7: Additional % tax for local orders (0=removes this prompt if
           no local tax is collected)
   Line 8: Output filename for record of pending orders.  This file
           receives the text of all completed orders.

   Line 9: Filename of introductory messages before "continue yes/no"
   Line 10: Filename of billing/ordering instructions
   Line 11: Filename of instructions displayed prior to file selection
   Line 12: Filename of final message after placing an order

   Line 13: Number disk formats available
   Line 14: First disk format.  Each disk format is defined in the following
   format:   AAAA BBBB CCCC DDDD EEEE FFFF
   where
      AAAA is the number of K bytes per disk
      BBBB is the cluster size for this disk type in K bytes
      CCCC is the basic charge per disk
      DDDD is the additional charge per megabyte
      EEEE is the additional charge per disk for overseas shipment
      FFFF ... the rest of the line is a description of the disk format

   Repeat line 14 for each additional disk format available.


The configuration file defines the company name, state and local tax
rates, the order log output file, various text display files and finally
the list of disk types that are supported.


                             Order logging
                             -------------

When an order is taken, critical information is placed in the CALLER log
and a new record (page) is written to the end of DBMAIL.LOG file.  The
DBMAIL.LOG file is a text file which contains the final and ONLY
complete record of the transaction.  I am writing other programs (see
the HS/Link Office Automation System) to read this log file automate the
disk production process and to produce an invoice and shipping list for
order fulfilment.

Here is a sample of an order record:
