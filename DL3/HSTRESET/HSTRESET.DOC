           A solution to the "reset" problem with HST modems
         A quick way to place hayes compatible modems off-hook

This is a small program that will reset your HST modem.  It can be used
in your BOARD.BAT file to prevent PCBoard from getting into an endless
"modem reset error" loop when the phone is ringing.

HSTRESET is very simple.  It places the modem off-hook and then returns
to the BBS.  It knows about the two messages that the HST can generate,
and will handle them automatically.

HSTRESET is also useful in your AUTOEXEC file to place your BBS modems
off-hook while the system is booting up and going through the
initialization prior to loading up the BBS software.


USAGE
=====

HSTRESET port

For example,
        HSTRESET 1
for COM1, and
        HSTRESET 2
for COM2.

'port' may be 1 through 8.

To use non-standard COM ports, add SET statements before calling
hstreset.  For example, to reset a com port at 338 hex (824 decimal) and
irq 4, the statements
        SET COMIRQ=4
        SET COMBASE=824
        HSTRESET 1


INSTALLATION
============

First, you need to use PCBSETUP to change tell PCBoard to drop to DOS
after each caller.  This will give HSTRESET a chance to do it's work.

Next, pkace a copy of HSTRESET.EXE in your pcboard system directory (or
any other directory listed in PATH).

Finally, edit your board.bat file.  Here is the one I use:

   1.    @echo off
   2.    if exist event.bat rename event.bat event.sys
   3.    if exist remote.bat rename remote.bat remote.sys
   4.    if exist door.bat del door.bat
   5.    if exist endpcb del endpcb
   6.    pcboard
   7.    if exist door.bat door
   8.    if exist remote.bat remote
   9.    if exist event.bat event
   10.   if exist endpcb goto end
   11.   board
   12.   :end
   13.   del endpcb
   14.   hstreset 1              <<-- "hstreset 2" for com2
   15.   if errorlevel 1 board
   16.   echo Type BOARD to restart PCBoard

Notice that I added lines 14 and 15 to a "standard" board.bat file. Line
14 calls up HSTRESET to reset COM1:. Line 15 checks to see if you really
want to drop to DOS.  If you pressed (escape) while in HSTRESET, the
batch file will fall through to line 16 and drop to dos.  Otherwise, it
will recycle the board.
