                          DLFIND 1.2 (10/5/92)
                     Copyright 1992 Samuel H. Smith

     Finds filespecs using PCBoard style DLPATH.LST directory list.


Usage: dlfind [-e] FILESPEC ... FILESPEC
Specify one or more wildcard filespecs on the command line.

-E option specifies that FILESPEC.* should be checked, regardless of the
actual .EXT specified.

On exit, ERRORLEVEL is set to the number of matches.

Please execute the command:
   SET DLPATH=[full drive, directory and filename of your DLPATH.LST file]
before using DLFIND.  For example:
   SET DLPATH=C:\PCB\DLPATH.LST
   DLFIND PKZ110.*

I recommend you place the SET DLPATH statement in your AUTOEXEC file so you can
later use DLFIND at any time you wish.

You can use DLFIND to easily locate a file in any of your BBS download
directories.  All matching files are written to standard output.

You can use DLFIND to find duplicates with alternate file .EXT
extentions.  For example,
        DLFIND -E FILE.ZIP
        IF ERRORLEVEL 1 ECHO DUPLICATION FOUND!
This will report "DUPLICATION FOUND" if FILE.ARJ, FILE.GIF, etc, are
present in a download directory.

The DLPATH.LST file is a simple text file with each line containing one
full directory specification.  For example:

V:\BOOST\
U:\DL4\
U:\DL3\
U:\DL2\
U:\DL1\
J:\UPLOAD\


                            REVISION HISTORY

10/4/92 Version 1.2
     Added logic to strip a drive:\path from the filespec.  Otherwise no
     matches were ever reported when using under ProDoor's PROUT1.BAT
     example files.
