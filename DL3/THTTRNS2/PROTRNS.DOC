This is a modified protrns for ProLogon 1.3+ and ProDoor 3.5+
I have done alot of work on this PROTRNS it is 99.9%
done with PCB 14.5 color codes but there are some things
that will not take the @x codes so for these I have used 
asci codes.

I have in the protrns some $DISP-$ to display the Login
screens I have included these with the protrns files
I am also using the PROANS to display my welcome screen.

This should be one of the most complete Protrns file
available on any BBS.

You will also have to set the  FORCE_MSG_SCAN TO "MAIN"
also the FORCE_SCAN_COMMAND TO "N" and the DISPLAY_NEWS TO "OFF"
for the login $DISP-$ TO pause the screen so the user can read
his or her stats.

Have included a PROLON.CNF for reference.

FORCE_MSG_SCAN MAIN     ; Forces a MAIN ONLY or ALL cnf scan for msgs.    
                        ; VALUES -->  OFF, ALL, or MAIN                   
                        ; Default if missing or commented out--> OFF      
                        ; If OFF, the caller will be asked at login.      
                        ; If ALL or MAIN, no asking, it is FORCED         
                        ; If ALL, ALL conferences will be scanned.        
                        ; If MAIN, caller can OVER-RIDE and get ALL cnfs. 
                        ; Editors Choice --> MAIN                         

FORCE_SCAN_COMMAND N    ; "J ?" command to use when force is on           
                        ; VALUES -->  N, Y, S                             
                        ; ie.    N = J N    Y = J Y   S = J S             
                        ; Editors Choice --> N  (see all NEW msgs)        
                        ; Each of these commands will produce different   
                        ; results, you should experiment to see which     
                        ; is best for you.                                
                        ; Note: If FORCE_MSG_SCAN is NOT active,          
                        ;       this line will have NO effect.            

DISPLAY_NEWS OFF        ;DISPLAY_NEWS ON causes internal display of
                        ;conference news, but defeats the initial "scan
                        ;for personal mail" prompt.
                        ;DISPLAY_NEWS OFF causes prologon to trigger a
                        ;news display and personal mail scan when
                        ;ProDoor is first opened.
                        ;DISPLAY_NEWS BOTH causes internal display of
                        ;conference news, and also signals ProDoor to
                        ;perform the "personal mail" scan when first opened.


Files that I have included with this set are
" PROTRNS.ZIP " " PROTRNS.ZIP "  " PROANS " " CHAT.PCB "


"PROTRNS.ZIP "

This is for Prolon.exe put this in the same dir as the
prolon.exe file also the HTLOGON, HTLOGON2, SPECIAL and PROANS
file in this sub.



" PROTRNS.ZIP "

This one is for the ProDoor sub and should be placed in the directory
that you have your ProDoor.exe file, I have also included another
$DISP-$ file for the ProDoor Protrns file it will display when the
Sysop is not available for chat "CHAT.PCB" this will display.


All display screens where created with PCBEDIT from Clark Development.

If you have never had any experence with PROTRNS these files will
give you a real good idea how it works.


SYSPAGE.TRN
Have also included a protrns file for the SYSPAGE door from THP
