                  INSTALLING HS/LINK EXTERNAL PROTOCOL
                      IN RBBS-PC VERSION 17.3C

     Please refer to the RBBS-PC documentation for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  This information was tested with
     HS/Link betas posted on 12/04/91 and RBBS-PC v17.4/0912.

     The following installation steps should work for most folks:
     RBBS-PC uses a template file called PROTO.DEF for passing parameters
     to external protocols.  This template file can either call a BATCH
     file or pass parameters directly to the protocol engine.  Using either
     method ( BATCH or the direct passing of parameters directly to the
     engine will work.

     BATCH files are not needed with RBBS-PC's external protocol management
     template ( PROTO.DEF ).

SETTING UP HS/Link:

      1.) RBBS-PC's proto.def template file consists two lines for each
          Protocol.  The first line of the entry for a provides the
          information to the remote user for selecting the protocol to use
          when requesting to transfer a file.
      2.) The second line are the actual parameters passed between RBBS-PC
          and the protocol.  The send parameters are begin after RBBS-PC
          reads its own instructions.

          BELOW is the actual PROTO.DEF entry cut and pasted from a working
          PROTO.DEF file. If you wish you can cut and paste this line into
          your own PROTO.DEF file:

      "H) HS/Link ...................[98% Eff.]
      "20,D,8,,B,4096,,0.98,,4=E=A,"C:\RBBS\XFER\HSLINK.EXE -@ -NF -HX -NU -P[PORT#] -b[BAUD] -S4096 [FILE]","C:\RBBS\XFER\HSLINK.EXE -@ -NF -HX -UC:\UPLOAD -P[PORT#] -b[BAUD] -S4096"

          (Note: the second line has no carriage returns but the parameters
            are broken up by commas and QUOTE Marks.)

    a. The first Quote ( by the H ) to the second quote sectors off
             the menu selection.
    b. Following the quote are the parameters passed to RBBS-PC. Read
        the RBBS-PC documentation for more detail on these parameters.

    c. RBBS-PC'S parameters for SENDing a file with HS/Link:

       "C:\RBBS\XFER\HSLINK.EXE -@ -NF -HX -NU -P[PORT#] -b[BAUD] -S4096 [FILE]"
       -@ runs HS/Link without accessing the HSLINK.CFG file

       -NF turns off the graphics screen ( though nice, I'm not around to
           watch and enjoy it so am not putting the screen to work.

       -HX turns of the Xon/XOFF feature.  If using an error correcting
           modem such as a USR HST or DS this feature is not needed if you do
           not use an error correction modem leave this switch out.

       -NU Blocks uploads as RBBS-PC is not designed to handle simultaneous
           file transfers.

       -P[PORT#] tells HS/Link which port to use.

       -b[BAUD] passes the modem speed to HS/Link. HS/Link autodetects the
                speed but I like to keep it in there as I run a fossil driver
                and error correcting modem that takes care of all that
                adjustment.  Church Chatters opens and locks its ports
                at 19200

       -S4096 passes the buffer size to HS/Link.  May require experimentation.
                You may want to go to a smaller buffer if you are not
                using the NS16550AFN chips.
       [FILE] this is self explanitory.  The most important thing to your
              valued user!


         These parameters will pass the information to send a file to the
         remote user.  RBBS is not designed to accept two way transfers tho
         there is a group of us testing an interface to take care of both
         batch uploading and two way transfers.  This utility however, is not
         part of the officially released RBBS-PC code.  Documentation on
         handling HS/Link with external utilities will be packaged with those
         utilities.

    d. RBBS-PC parameters to RECIEVE a file with HS/Link:

      "C:\RBBS\XFER\HSLINK.EXE -@ -NF -HX -UC:\UPLOAD -P[PORT#] -b[BAUD] -S4096"
       The only different parameters in this string are:

       -UC:\UPLOAD names the subdirectory you want to receive files to.

       -NU we do not want to block uploads here.
   This setup should work with any version of RBBS-PC using the PROTO.DEf
   protocol template file.

     The following message was released on the Relay International
          Mail Exchanger in the RBBS conference by DAN SHORE:

        Announcing a new Feature/Interface for RBBS:

                1.  BATCH UPLOADING with DSZ Protocols
                2.  HS/Link Interface

      These New Features are currently in Beta Testing at the
      following "DGS Systems Group" BBS's, and is expected to be
      released to the general public in the next couple of weeks.

   RBBS-PC is not designed to handle BATCH uploads. Though  not part of the
   officially released RBBS-PC the above mentioned package but should further
   enhance the use of HS/Link with RBBS when it is released. It will handle
   HS/Link among many other protocols.
