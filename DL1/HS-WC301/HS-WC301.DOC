                  INSTALLING HS/LINK EXTERNAL PROTOCOL
                      IN WILDCAT! BBS VERSION 3.01

     Please refer to the WILDCAT! manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  This information was tested
     with HS/Link betas posted on 11/19/91 and WILDCAT! test drive
     version 3.01.

     The following installation steps should work for most folks:

     Wildcat! stores the protocol programs and batch files in the
     "external protocols directory",  which is defined on line 13 of
     frame 7 in the MAKEWILD.EXE configuration program.  The default
     setting is C:\WILDCAT\EP, but please substitute your own directory
     in the following examples.  If you use some other directory, you
     will also have to change the "CD" statements in the provided
     HS-U.BAT and HS-D.BAT files.

     Place a copy of HSLINK.EXE into your protocol directory,
     C:\WILDCAT\EP.  Also copy the supplied HS-U.BAT and HS-D.BAT files
     into the C:\WILDCAT\EP directory.

     Run MAKEWILD.EXE and access frame 8.  Add 1 to the number of
     external protocols defined by item 3.

     Next access frame 18 and enter the following definitions for the
     HS/Link protocol:

     This should get you set up in under 10 minutes.

     Wildcat 3.01 does not support bidirectional transfers.  If the
     caller attempts to upload multiple files, or files that do not
     match the filename given in advance, the resulting upload file may
     be corrupt or misnamed.

     I understand that Mustang software is currently working on a new
     version of Wildcat! which will have these capabilities.  Please
     contact Mustang for upgrade information.

     Note for systems running locked COM ports:
     We have found that if you use a locked DTE of 9600 or above, you
     will need to have a NS16550AN UART installed.  Also, for rock solid
     performance you should add the -HS (Handshake Slow) switch to your
     'HS-D.BAT' and 'HS-U.BAT' batch files.

     You can edit HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT to include options on the HSLINK
     command line, but most folks won't need to change anything. If your
     system can't keep up with the COM port while accessing the disk
     drive, you may want to add -HS to the command line in each file.
     If you want to experiment, there are a number of optional
     parameters you can read about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.

     Contents of HS-D.BAT
     --------------------
         echo off
         REM download from Wildcat 3.01
         if exist transfer.bad del transfer.bad
         hslink -p%2 -HS -NU -NV %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

     Contents of HS-U.BAT
     --------------------
         echo off
         REM upload to Wildcat 3.01
         if exist transfer.bad del transfer.bad
         hslink -P%2 -HS -NV
     

     I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
     responsibility for any damages resulting from these instructions.
     If you get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come
     with Wildcat! and with HS/Link.  If all else fails, call up the
     Tool Shop and ask for help on the Support Conference.  Either I
     will help you, or somebody else will know the answer and give you a
     hand.

     Good luck!
