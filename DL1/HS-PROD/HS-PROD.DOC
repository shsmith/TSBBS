                 IN PRODOOR 3.43 (BETAS DATED 10/30/91)
 
                                  
     Please refer to the PRODOOR manual and change history for detailed
     information on installation of external protocols.  The following
     installation steps should work for most folks:


     To install HS/Link in ProDoor, add the following lines to the end
     of your PROD.CNF file:

     ;
     98 H 0 T 50 HS/Link (Bi-directional)
     hslink -p$N$ -e$C$ -u$PLAY$ $@$ -a
     ;
     98 H 0 R 0 HS/Link
     hslink -p$N$ -e$C$ -u$PLAY$
     ;

     This creates the 'H' protocol, which can be used with the (U)pload
     command for uploading only, or with the (D)ownload command for
     downloading only or simultaneous uploading and downloading.
