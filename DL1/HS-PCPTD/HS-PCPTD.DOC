     Installation: 

     Please refer to the PCPLUS manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  The following installation
     steps should work for most folks:

     Copy the provided HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT files, as well as
     HSLINK.EXE into your PCPLUS directory, or into a directory included
     in your search PATH.

     If you're using a COM port other than COM1 you'll need to edit both
     HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT to change the -P1 to -P2 or whatever port
     you're using.  Most folks won't need to put anything else on the
     HSLINK command line, but there are a number of optional parameters
     you can read about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.

     Next you need to install the HS/LINK protocol into the PCPLUS
     protocol menu.

     Load up PCPLUSTD and press ALT-S to get into the SETUP menu.  Then
     cursor down to the PROTOCOL OPTIONS selection and press ENTER.  In
     this screen, you press C and then enter HS-U for the upload
     command, and finally press D and enter HS-D for the download
     command.  Escape from this menu and choose WRITE OPTIONS TO DISK to
     save your changes.

     To download with HS/LINK, first you tell the BBS you're talking to
     what files you want to download, and that you want to download in
     the HS/LINK protocol.  On the Tool Shop you can do this with the
     following command:
        D H filename filename S
     for example,
        D H TOOLSHOP.EXE S

     Once you've got the BBS into downloading mode, you press the PGDN
     key and select the HS-D protocol from the menu.  When asked for
     "parameters" just press enter.

     If you want to also upload to the
     BBS while downloading, you simply press the PGUP key instead of
     PGDN, select HS-U from the menu, and list the upload filenames you
     want to have transmitted.

I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
responsibility for anydamages resulting from these instructions.  If you
get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come with PCPLUS
and with HSLINK.  If all else fails, call up the tool shop and ask for
help on the main board.  Either I will help you, or somebody else will
know the answer and give you a hand.

Good luck!
