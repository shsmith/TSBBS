     Installation: 

     Please refer to the TELEMATE manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  The following installation
     steps should work for most folks:

     Copy the provided HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT files, as well as
     HSLINK.EXE into your TELEMATE directory, or into a directory
     included in your search PATH.

     You can edit HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT to include options on the HSLINK
     command line, but most folks won't need to change anything.  If you
     want to experiment, there are a number of optional parameters you
     can read about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.  The first thing you
     might want to do is add a -Udrive:\path statement to direct your
     downloads to your download directory, instead of having them placed
     into the current directory.

     Next you need to install the HS/LINK protocol into the TELEMATE
     protocol menu.

     Load up TELEMATE and press ALT-O to get into the OPTIONS menu.  Then
     cursor down to the PROTOCOLS selection and press ENTER.  In this
     screen, you tab down to the EXTERNAL PROTOCOLS section.

     The default TELEMATE configuration defines all available external
     protocols, so you will need to replace one of them with HS/Link.
     The least efficient protocol is KERMIT, so this is a good choice to
     replace with HS/Link.

     Tab down to the "Protocol Name" which was originally "KERMIT" and
     change it to "HS/Link".
     Tab to "Key" and change it to "H".
     Tab to "Upload Batch" and change it to "HS-U.BAT".
     Tab to "Download Batch" and change it to "HS-D.BAT".
     Tab to "Prompt download filenames" and change it to "blank".
     Tab to "Auto Download Sequence" and change it to the three
     characters ^, B and R (it should look like: ^BR).

     Then press ENTER to get out of this screen and cursor down to SAVE
     CHANGES and press ENTER to save your changes.

     To download with HS/LINK, first you tell the BBS you're talking to
     what files you want to download, and that you want to download in
     the HS/LINK protocol.  On the Tool Shop you can do this with the
     following command:
        D H filename filename S
     for example,
        D H TOOLSHOP.EXE S

     Once you've got the BBS into downloading mode, HS/Link will
     automatically be loaded and the download will begin.

     If you want to also upload to the BBS while downloading, you simply
     press the PGUP key, select HS/LINK from the menu, and list the
     upload filenames you want to have transmitted.

I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
responsibility for anydamages resulting from these instructions.  If you
get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come with TELEMATE
and with HSLINK.  If all else fails, call up the tool shop and ask for
help on the main board.  Either I will help you, or somebody else will
know the answer and give you a hand.

Good luck!
