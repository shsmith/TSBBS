                  USING BOYAN 5.0 WITH EXTERNAL HS/LINK
                                  
     Please refer to the BOYAN manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  The following installation
     steps should work for most folks:

     Copy HSLINK.EXE into your BOYAN directory.  If you have changed the
     "path for extrnal protocols" option (ALT-C/D/H) then place
     HSLINK.EXE into the configured directory instead.

     Next you need to install the HS/LINK protocol into the BOYAN
     protocol menu.

     Load up BOYAN and press ALT-C to get into the CONFIGURATION menu.  Then
     press "X" for EXTENDED TRANSFER PROTOCOLS.

     Press "8" to define a new protocol (use any available protocol
     number if #8 is already in use).

     When prompted for "Protocol Name" enter "HS/Link" and press ENTER.
     When prompted for "Menu Letter" enter "H" and press ENTER.
     When prompted for "External File" enter "HSLINK.EXE" and press
     ENTER.
     When prompted for "BATCH" enter "YES" and press ENTER.
     When prompted for "Auto-DL string" enter the 3 characters "^", "B"
     and "R" and press ENTER.
     When prompted for "HS/Link Upload" enter "\DC-[%P:HSLINK -P%MD %TF]"
     When prompted for "HS/Link Download" enter "\DC-[%P:HSLINK -P%MD ]"

     Then press ESCAPE twice to get out of configuration mode.

     You can edit the "HS/Link Upload" and "HS/Link Download" entries to
     include options on the HSLINK command line, but most folks won't
     need to change anything.  If you want to experiment, there are a
     number of optional parameters you can read about in HSLINK.DOC and
     HSLINK.NEW.

     To download with HS/LINK, just tell the BBS you're talking to what
     files you want to download, and that you want to download in the
     HS/LINK protocol.  On the Tool Shop you can do this with the
     following command:
        D H filename filename S
     for example,
        D H TOOLSHOP.EXE S

     Once you've got the BBS into downloading mode, HS/Link Auto
     Download should automatically take place.

     If you want to also upload to the BBS while downloading, you simply
     press the PGUP key BEFORE the Auto-Download starts, select HS/LINK
     from the menu, and list the upload filenames you want to have
     transmitted.

I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
responsibility for anydamages resulting from these instructions.  If you
get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come with BOYAN
and with HSLINK.  If all else fails, call up the tool shop and ask for
help on the main board.  Either I will help you, or somebody else will
know the answer and give you a hand.

Good luck!
