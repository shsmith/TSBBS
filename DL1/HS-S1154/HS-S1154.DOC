                                    HSLINK
			IN THE SUPERBBS FROM AKI ANTMAN


Used version from SBBS: 1.15 Gamma4

In the used version the SBBS has a bug to use external protocols with a
CTL-File.  When later the bug is fixed (SBBS writes mismatch in the
beginning of the CTL-File) you can use the CTL-Option.

First add the following variable to your enviroment:
SET DSZLOG=<SBBSPATH>\LOG.OUT (Or a other name for your log).

In the SBBS setup put in the external protocol setup the following lines:

Activated		: Yes
Name			: HS/LINK 1.0
Key			: H
Batch			: Yes
Protocol type		: BIMODEM
Log style		: DSZ
Download command	: <SBBSPATH>\HSLINK.EXE %1
Upload command		: <SBBSPATH>\HSLINK.EXE %1
	Note:
        When you have problems with Errors change the line to:
        HSLINK.EXE -hs %1
Log file name		: LOG.OUT (The name from the DSZLOG-Variable)
Effic			: 98

When you use a upload path you can easy setup this with HSCONFIG.EXE.
You must not put the upload path in the command line.

That's all folks and HSLINK will works now! Easy, or ??? Many thanks to
Samuel H. Smith for this fast, error free and easy to use Filetransfer
protocol!!!
For Sam: Sorry for the wakeup call :-)...
