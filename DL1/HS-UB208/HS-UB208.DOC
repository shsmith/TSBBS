                  INSTALLING HS/LINK EXTERNAL PROTOCOL
                        IN ULTRABBS VERSION 2.08

     Please refer to the UltraBBS manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  This information was tested
     with HS/Link betas posted on 11/21/91 and UltraBBS version 2.08.

     The following installation steps should work for most folks:

     Place a copy of HSLINK.EXE and the provided HS.BAT file in your
     main C:\UBBS directory.

     Run SETUP.EXE and cursor down to EDIT CURRENT PROTOCOLS FILE and
     press enter.

     Press ALT-I to insert a new protocol.

     For "Letter:" enter "H".
     For "Name:" enter "HS/Link"
     For "Type:" enter "B"
     For "@ Support?" enter "Y"
     For "DSZ.LOG?" enter "Y"
     For "Download/Bidir BAT file" enter "HS.BAT"
     For "Upload BAT file" enter "HS.BAT"

     Exit the setup program.

     This should get you set up in under 10 minutes.

     You can edit the 'HS.BAT' batch file to include options on the
     HSLINK command line, but most folks won't need to change anything.
     If your system does not use the standard C:\UBBS\BATCH batch upload
     directory, you will need to edit both batch files and change
     references to C:\UBBS\BATCH to whatever is used in your
     installation.

     If your system can't keep up with the COM port while accessing the
     disk drive, you may want to add -HS to both lines.  If you want to
     experiment, there are a number of optional parameters you can read
     about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.

     Contents of HS.BAT
     ------------------
        rem HSLINK UPLOAD/DOWNLOAD UNDER ULTRABBS 2.08
        hslink -p%1 -hs @%3 -uC:\UBBS\BATCH

     When testing UltraBBS version 2.08 in this configuration I found
     that the last file in a download batch was never actually included
     in the batch.  This appears to be a bug in UBBS, which may be
     corrected in later versions.

     I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
     responsibility for any damages resulting from these instructions.
     If you get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come
     with UltraBBS and with HS/Link.  If all else fails, call up the
     Tool Shop and ask for help on the Support Conference.  Either I
     will help you, or somebody else will know the answer and give you a
     hand.

     Good luck!
