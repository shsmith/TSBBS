 
               USING QMODEM/PRO 1.5 WITH EXTERNAL HS/LINK
 
                                  
     Installation: 

     Please refer to the QMODEM PRO manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  The following installation
     steps should work for most folks:

     Copy the provided HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT files, as well as
     HSLINK.EXE into your QMOPRO directory, or into a directory included
     in your search PATH.

     You can edit HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT to include options on the HSLINK
     command line, but most folks won't need to change anything.  If you
     want to experiment, there are a number of optional parameters you
     can read about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.  The first thing you
     might want to do is add a -Udrive:\path statement to direct your
     downloads to your download directory, instead of having them placed
     into the current directory.

     Next you need to install the HS/LINK protocol into the QMODEM PRO
     protocol menu.

     Load up QMPRO and press ALT-Z C to get into the CONFIGURE menu.
     Then cursor down to the PROTOCOLS selection, press ENTER and then E
     to define external protocols.  In this screen, you press A to Add
     HS/Link as an external protocol.

     Set the "Select Character" to "H".
     Set the "Protocol Name" to "HS/Link".
     Set the "Upload BAT" to "HS-U.BAT".
     Set the "Download BAT" to "HS-D.BAT".
     Set the "Batch Download" to "Y".
     Set the "Batch Upload" to "Y".
     Set the "Download Autostart" to "HS*^BR".

     Then press OK to get out of this screen ESCAPE a few times to exit
     the setup menu.

     To download with HS/LINK, first you tell the BBS you're talking to
     what files you want to download, and that you want to download in
     the HS/LINK protocol.  On the Tool Shop you can do this with the
     following command:
        D H filename filename S
     for example,
        D H TOOLSHOP.EXE S

     Once you've got the BBS into downloading mode, QMPRO will
     automatically detect HS/Link and launch it for you.

     If you want to also upload to the BBS while downloading, you simply
     STOP SHORT of pressing the final ENTER key to begin a download, and
     instead press the PGUP key, select HS/LINK from the menu, click
     BATCH ENTRY and list the upload filenames you want to have
     transmitted and click UPLOAD.

I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
responsibility for any damages resulting from these instructions.  If
you get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come with
QMPRO and with HSLINK.  If all else fails, call up the tool shop and ask
for help on the main board.  Either I will help you, or somebody else
will know the answer and give you a hand.

Good luck!
