Description


        HSLBOY.BSC is a script to simplify unzipping and registering

        new copies of HSLink bidirectional file transfer protocol, as

        they are released. When run for the first time, it creates a

        file called ##HSL.FIL , which holds your registration serial

        number and password (or just  ## , if you are not registered).

        Then (and, on subsequent runs, at startup) the script presents

        a File Manager directory list of all files in your download

        directory that begin with "HS". From these, just highlight the

        version of HSLink you want, and press <Enter>. The script will

        unzip it into your external protocol directory, then enter your

        registration codes. No more searching in drawers for those docs,

        every time you download a new version of HSLink.




Installation and Use


        To use, just unzip HSLBOY.BSC into your Boyan script directory, and

        run it.  \SC[HSLBOY]  or Alt-R  HSLBOY  <Enter> . Be sure there is a

        copy of HSLK<xxx>.ZIP in your download directory, for the script to

        work on. It isn't necessary to delete any old HSLink files, as the

        unzipping is in overwrite (pkunzip -o) mode, so previous files of

        the same name are simply overwritten.


        The script does not process every file in HSLink, just those that

        fit the wildcard  HS*.* . This covered HSCONFIG.EXE, HSLINK.EXE,

        HSLINK.DOC, and HSLINK.NEW, in the version (1.12) used in testing.


        The script has been tested in several places, and seems to work

        well; I'd appreciate hearing of any bugs or suggestions. I can be

        reached on most any Boyan conference.


        Thanks to Matthew Waldron, Doug Manne, and Lee Breeden for testing

        and suggestions.
