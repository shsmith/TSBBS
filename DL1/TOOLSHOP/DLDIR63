586NPX.ZIP       2907  01-28-95  Turns off the floating point support of the
                               | Pentium processor. This software detects the
                               | specific level of the Pentium chip and
                               | redirects applications to use floating point
                               | emulation. However, using floating point
                               | emulation can degradate the performance of
                               | your application(s). For typical spreadsheet
                               | and word processor applications, this
                               | degradation will be minimal. For floating
                               | point-intensive applications, such as CAD,
                               | the degradation will be more noticeable. For
                               | OS/2 Warp customers, this solution works for
                               | all OS/2, DOS, and Windows applications.

                               | Organization: Intel. We have release a
                               | program CPUIDF.EXE which identifies the type
                               | of Intel microprocessor your PC contains. It
                               | will also tell you whether or not your
                               | Pentium (tm) processor has the floating point
                               | divide flaw.
CPUINF11.ZIP    16935  01-25-95  Identifies CPU type, tests for bugs.
