                               | GWBASIC... well, sort of. This language is
                               | specially designed to run as fast as possible
                               | and may seem more like real english than
                               | anything else. The purpose of BozoL is to
                               | allow you to add your own commands and
                               | functions. Use BozoL for process control,
