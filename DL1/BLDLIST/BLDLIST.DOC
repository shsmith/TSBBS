BLDLIST 1.0 of 02-25-90   (C) 1990 Samuel H. Smith

Usage:  BLDLIST dir ... dir [>out]

You may specify one or more directories to scan.  Subdirectories are
automatically included, so
        D:\
will scan all directories of drive D:, while
        D:\DL
will scan D:\DL and all subdirectories under D:\DL.


Example:
        BLDLIST C:\DL1 D:\DL2 K:\ >C:\PCB\GEN\DLINFO.DAT
        BLTLIST L:\COMM L:\GIF L:\EDIT L:\GRAPH >>C:\PCB\GEN\DLINFO.DAT

You can run BLDLIST multiple times, appending the results to a single
output listing.

I recommend you create a batch or EVENT to automatically update this
listing file if it refers to directories that are being updated.

ProDoor betas dated 2-26-90 and later are able to process such a file list
when included in a DLPATH.LST file.  For example:

DLPATH.LST
----------

U:\UPLOAD\
M:\SYSOPS\
M:\MAG\
@C:\PCB\GEN\DLINFO.DAT
M:\DISK\
@C:\PCB\GEN\CR-ROM1.DAT

When a DLPATH entry starts with '@' it is expected to specify the full
filename of a file-listing file created with BLDLIST.  This can be used
to speed up searching of slow drives.  You can also use this to reduce
network traffic if you list network download directories and place the
listing on a local drive.


Format of BLDLIST output:

BLDLIST produces output in the following format:

{directory}
{file1}
{file2}
{filen}
{directory}
{file1}
...

This format saves space by not repeating the full directory for each
file to be listed.

Please note:  each {directory} specified MUST start with a drive letter.
For example, M:\DL2 is correct, but \DL2 will not work correctly.
