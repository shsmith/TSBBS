HS/Link Revision History (in reverse order)
-------------------------------------------

24-Mar-95
   The 12-Mar beta sometimes hangs or acts strangely following the first
   completed INCOMING file.

   Corrected some errors in new screen alignment.

   Corrected incoming-file crash recovery (broken in 1.21C4).

12-Mar-95
   Corrected bug in registration activation process.

   Preparation for final release.

   Changed status display layout to more closely match that of the
   Windows DLP version.

   Posted as public beta 1.21C4 under filename HS121C4.ZIP.

17-Nov-94
   Posted as public beta 1.21C2 under filename HS121C2.ZIP.

16-Nov-94
   Removed the internal EXE file CRC check during program startup.
   This change should speed up program loading and reliability in some
   environments.

   As of this beta, registration fees are rolled back to the original
   $15 price set in 1991.

15-Jul-94
   Changed tamper detection logic to report possible tampering via
   the chat windows instead of breaking the connection.  This may
   help with perceived reliability where hacking is commonplace.

14-May-94
   THE TOOL SHOP HAS MOVED!  Our Post Office Box is unchanged, but all
   programs and files have been updated to reflect the new telephone
   numbers:
      New Tool Shop BBS v.32bis FREE line............... 213-851-2393
      New Tool Shop BBS v.32bis SUBSCRIBER/ORDER line... 213-851-2127
      New Tool Shop BBS USR HST 9600 line............... 213-851-2314
      New VOICE LINE for ORDERS and TECHNICAL SUPPORT... 213-851-9969
      New FAX line...................................... 213-851-4691

   Because no further changes are planned for this beta cycle, this may
   be the FINAL BETA before the next official release version.

   IF YOU NEED TECHNICAL SUPPORT, YOU MUST CALL THE VOICE LINE AND TALK
   TO SAMUEL SMITH DIRECTLY!

   Posted as public beta 1.21C0 under filename HS121C0.ZIP (english
   version) and HS121GC0.ZIP (german version).

18-Feb-94
   Corrected -NO processing logic to properly handle lower case and
   trailing spaces within a duplication list file.

08-Feb-94
   Posted as a public beta 1.21B7 (german version)

17-Nov-93
   Changes in RTS logic may solve problems with INTERNAL modems that
   require the -HR option to work.

19-Jul-93
   Posted as public beta 1.21B6 under filename HS121B6.ZIP (english
   version) and HS121GB6.ZIP (german version).

   Created German language version of HSCONFIG.EXE.

   Special thanks to Martin Thommen of CommNET communications for his
   assistance in the German translation.

12-Jul-93
   Posted as public beta 1.21B4 under filename HS121B4.ZIP.

   Created German language versions of HSLINK.EXE and FHSLINK.EXE.  These
   will be posted as HS121GB4.ZIP.

15-Jun-93
   Posted as public beta 1.21B2 under filename HS121B2.ZIP.

12-Jun-93
   Removed the normal 2 second CHAT timeout if the outgoing channel is
   currently idle, making CHAT much smoother under some circumstances.

18-May-93
   Added logic to also disable XON/XOFF handshake during transfer abort
   sequences.

   Corrected logic to prevent occasional failed connections when -MN and
   -HX options were being used on only one side of the link.

06-May-93
   Added logic to automatically disable CTS handshake during transfer
   abort sequences.  This will prevent HSLINK waiting indefinitely for a
   modem that has a locked up CTS signal to respond to the abort strings.

   Maintenance release of HS/Link 1.21 as HS121.ZIP.  See WHATSNEW.121
   for a complete list of changes between version 1.20 and version 1.21.

11-Apr-93
   Official release of HS/Link 1.20 as HS120.ZIP. See WHATSNEW.120 for a
   complete list of changes between version 1.1 and version 1.2.

11-Dec-92
   Added logic to cause hslink to assume an outgoing file from an unspecified
   directory will be located in the directory of the previously specified
   outgoing file.  For example:
        hslink c:\dir1\file1 file2 file3
   means the same as
        hslink c:\dir1\file1 c:\dir1\file2 c:\dir1\file3

13-Nov-92
   Added a check for
        SET HSERR=path\logfile
   to enable a new error logging facility.  When enabled, most screen
   information and error messages are logged to the specified logfile.

14-May-92
   Official release of version 1.12 as HS112.ZIP.

13-May-92
   Official release of HS/Link 1.10 as HSLINK11.ZIP. See WHATSNEW.110 for a

   Initial protocol design and prototype development began but was never made
   functional enough for public testing.
