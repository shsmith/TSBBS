To patch OpusComm 5.30 to make the watchdog functionality work
properly, apply the patches contained in this archive.  There is one
patch for each of the .COM files in the original OCOM_530.ARC file. 
To use the patches, run them as follows:

   DEBUG OPUSCOM1.COM < OPUSCOM1.PAT
   DEBUG OPUSCOMM.COM < OPUSCOMM.PAT

They will patch the correct locations to fix the problem, as well as
change the version number to 5.31 to avoid confusion.
