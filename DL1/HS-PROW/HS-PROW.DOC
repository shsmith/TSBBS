     HS/Link can be installed in PROWIN only if your modem can be
     programmed to disregard the DTR signal.  For most popular modems,
     this can be done by adding &D0 to your dialing prefix.  For
     example, you should change the dialing prefix from
        ATDT
     to
        AT&D0DT
     Without this change, you will lose carrier when you bring up
     HS/Link from inside PROWIN.

     Installation: 

     Please refer to the PROWIN manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  The following installation
     steps should work for most folks:

     Copy the provided HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT files, as well as
     HSLINK.EXE into your PROCOMM directory, or into a directory
     included in your search PATH.

     Please edit HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT to make sure they specify the
     correct values for your COM PORT, PORT SPEED and DOWNLOAD
     DIRECTORY.  The defaults are COM1, 2400 and C:\DOWNLOAD.  Please
     note that in this environment, you MUST use the -Bxxxx option to
     specify the COM port speed as HSLINK will not be able to determine
     it automatically under Windows.

     Most folks won't need to put anything else on the HSLINK command
     line, but there are a number of optional parameters you can read
     about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.

     Next you need to install the HS/LINK protocol into PROWIN as a set
     of two "metakeys".

     Create a metakey to run the program HS-D.BAT and title the key
     "HS/Link Download".   Create another metakey to run the program
     HS-U.BAT and title the key "HS/Link Upload".

     To download with HS/LINK, first you tell the BBS you're talking to
     what files you want to download, and that you want to download in
     the HS/LINK protocol.  On the Tool Shop you can do this with the
     following command:
        D H filename filename S
     for example,
        D H TOOLSHOP.EXE S

     Once you've got the BBS into downloading mode, use the mouse to
     click the "HS/Link Download" metakey.

     If you want to also upload to the BBS while downloading, you simply
     click the "HS/Link Upload" metakey instead of "HS/Link Download".
     You will then be routed to the POINT AND SHOOT utility, COMMOPNS,
     which allows you to flag the files to be uploaded.  When you ESCAPE
     from POINT AND SHOOT, the transfer will begin.

     COMMOPNS is a POINT-AND-SHOOT utility written by by Shad Muegge and
     Marcos Della.  It can be obtained from PNS52.ZIP or newer. COMMOPNS
     is shareware (registration $10) - Please register it if you use it.

I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
responsibility for anydamages resulting from these instructions.  If you
get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come with PROWIN
and with HSLINK.  If all else fails, call up the tool shop and ask for
help on the main board.  Either I will help you, or somebody else will
know the answer and give you a hand.

Good luck!
