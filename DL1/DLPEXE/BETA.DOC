              !!!!!!!!!!!!!! BETA TEST VERSION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    Beta Testing is a means of getting widespread exposure to unfinished
    versions of a program during the development process.  The idea is for
    as many users as possible to "beta test" the program and to make
    suggestions and report bugs.  This type of widespread testing can lead
    to a very stable and bug-free finished product (the RELEASE version).
    Please read HSLINK.NEW to see what has been changed recently.  If you
    encounter problems or would like to make a suggestion, please read the
    SUPPORT section of HSLINK.DOC for instructions on how to reach the
    author.

    HS/Link product support is available by voice at (213) 851-9969
    between 12 noon and 8pm pacific time, WEDNESDAY through SUNDAY.
