 | application(s). For typical spreadsheet and word processor applications,
 | this degradation will be minimal. For floating point-intensive
 | applications, such as CAD, the degradation will be more noticeable. For
 | OS/2 Warp customers, this solution works for all OS/2, DOS, and Windows

OS2PNG01.ZIP    78276  09-15-95  Converts GIF files to the new, improved and
 | free graphic format PNG (Portable Network Graphic). libpng is a general-
 | purpose library for working with PNG files, and it is used by gif2png. PNG
 | was developed after Unisys decided to enforce their patent on the LZW
 | compression algorithm. As a result of this patent, developers of software
 | which uses GIF must pay royalties. PNG ("ping") was developed to replace
 | GIF without requiring the payment of roytalties. PNG not only replaces GIF,
 | but it also fixes many of GIF's shortcomings and adds new features.
