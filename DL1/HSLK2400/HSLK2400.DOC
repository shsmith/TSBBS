                   HS/Link Installation for 2400 Baud Modems

                        by Matt Hall (aka Skoal Bandit)


DOWNLOADING HS/LINK

      To acquire a copy of the most innovative protocol available, call a
local BBS or The Tool Shop (818-891-6780) and search the file section for the
keyword; "HS".  Use your current favorite protocol for the last time while you
download the highest available version of HSLK????.ZIP.

VERSIONS

      HS/Link is unique in the way that its versions are numbered.  Version
X.Y·Z is completely untested if Z is an even integer and is slightly tested if
Z is an odd integer.  If Z is an even integer, the file should not be
distributed and should only be downloaded from The Tool Shop.  If · exists in
the version number then it is a beta testing release and may have minor bugs. 
If · does not exist in the version number, the version has passed its testing
phase.
      Nearly every version is safe so you should look for the highest version
number that does not have an even Z integer at the end.  Even those versions
are usually alright but they should never be uploaded to any BBS.

HS/LINK DIRECTORY

      I suggest making a directory called HSLINK right off of the directory
that your communications software is located.  For example, I unzip HS/Link
archives into C:\TELIX\HSLINK\ after I download new versions.  As you can see,
I use Telix so if you do too then you are already on the right track.  If not,
you can still use HS/Link but I cannot guarantee that these instructions will
work.

DOCUMENTATION

      Be sure to read the documentation that is included inside the HS/Link
archive.  It has recently been updated and goes into more detail than this
text file.

HSCONFIG.EXE

      After HS/Link has been unzipped into a directory of its own, change to
that directory and type HSCONFIG and press Enter.  This is the program that
you should run to configure HS/Link's options.  These options can be set from
a command line too but this way is much easier.
      The first option in HSCONFIG is "COM port number."  This can be
determined by looking in the configuration of your communications software. 
The second option is "Directory for downloaded file."  This can also be
determined by looking in the configuration of your communications software
(called "download direcotry" in Telix and most others).  If your
communications software does not have an entry for a download directory,
decide where you want all of the files that you download from BBSs to go.  My
download directory (and also my upload directory, which you will need to know
later if you are using Telix) is C:\TEMP\ and is defined in my Telix
configuration.  The third option is "SLOW HANDSHAKE."  In most cases this
should be No.  The only time that you might want to set it to Yes is if your
hard drive is slow and/or you get several errors during transfers.
      Press PageDown to go to the next page of options.  The first option is
"Non-standard COM base."  This option should be set to 0 in most cases,
consult your modem manual if you think you might have a strange COM port
setup.  The next option is "Non-standard COM IRQ."  Once again, consult your
modem manual if you think you might have a strange COM port setup.  The next
option is "COM port open speed."  This option should be 0.  If you have some
strange baud rate situation, this should still be 0 and you should use the -B
option in a batch file.  The next option is "Effective modem-to-modem speed." 
This is the baud rate that HS/Link will use to calculate transfer times.  If
you have a normal 2400 baud modem, this should be 0.  However, if you have a
2400 baud MNP modem this should be set to 2400 so that HS/Link will work with
MNP but will still estimate transfer times at 2400bd which is more accurate
than what your COM port will be set at.  If you are not sure about MNP,
consult your modem manual and if it doesn't mention MNP then you don't have
it.  The next two options ("CTS handshake" and "RTS handshake") should both be
set to No if you don't have an MNP modem, if you do have an MNP then these
should both be set to Yes.  The "XON/XOFF handshake" option should be set to
Yes if you have a normal 2400 baud modem or set to No if you have an MNP
modem.  The next option is "Enable Carrier Detect" and should be set to Yes in
most cases.  The last option on this page is "original time/date stamp."  This
option should be set to Yes if you want to keep whatever date is on each file
when you download it or set to No if you want all files that you download to
be stamped with the date that your computer shows when the download occurs. 
It's probably best to be set to Yes.
      Press PageDown again to go to the next page.  The first three options
("Resume aborted transfers", "Keep partial files", and "overwrite/modify
existing files") are designed to allow you to resume aborted downloads if they
are aborted.  If you want to be able to resume aborted downloads, set the
first three options on this page to Yes.  If, for some strange reason (if
you're a sysop, you will have to decide if you want this or not), you don't
want to be able to resume aborted downloads then set the first three options
to No.  The fourth option on this page is "file read/write buffering."  This
option should be set to Yes in most cases.  The "Dynamic-Code-Substitution" is
what makes HS/Link faster than other protocols.  This option should be set to
Yes in most cases.  The next option is "Size of transmitted data blocks." 
Most protocols use 1024 (which is also the HS/Link default) but I have found
that 2048 is better for larger files.  I recommend 2048 for this option but
1024 will work just as well usually.  The next option is "blocks in transit
before ACK is required."  This option is not very significant so I suggest
leaving it at 8.  The next option is "Disable transmission of ACK" and I also
suggest leaving this at No.  The final option on this page is "Force remote
unit to use local option settings" and should be set to Yes unless you are a
BBS operator.  If you are a BBS operator and you plan on using HS/Link with
communications software and BBS software, this option should be set to No.  If
you want to use this option for your communications software, include -! in
your command line inside your HS/Link batch file (which will be explained
later).  You should also use -NU in the HS/Link batch file if you are a sysop
and your BBS software does not support two way transfers (the BBS software
won't stop HS/Link from transferring both directions unless you use -NU but
the BBS software must be able to detect that files were uploaded; most BBS
software needs some kind of interface that will allow it to detect uploads).
      Press PageDown again to go to the next page.  The first option is "Idle
method."  If you're not sure, this option should probably be set to 0.  The
next option is "NS16550AN buffering."  This option should usually be set to
Yes and is not very significant.  "Minimal-Blocks" should only be set to Yes
if you have an MNP modem.  "Incoming file duplication check list" should be
left blank unless you have a text file containing a list of files that you
already have (this option might be able to be used with certain BBS software). 
"DSZLOG status logging file" should be set if you want to have a DSZ.LOG for
your transfers.  The final option is "Force CTS handshake."  This option is
for MNP modems and is insignificant in most cases.  If you're not sure about
this option, set it to No.
      Press PageDown one more time to go to the last page.  The first option
here is "Full-Screen status display."  This should be set to Yes (if you are a
BBS operator then you might need to put -NF in your BBS command line for
HS/Link to disable the full-screen display).  The next option is "direct video
writing" and should be set to Yes unless you are using HS/Link through
Desqview, DoubleDOS, or other programs that cannot handle direct video
writing.  The final five options are color options.  These can be set to
whatever you think looks the best.  You can either choose your own colors,
leave the colors that the author of HS/Link has defined, or use my colors
which are: 9, 25, 26, 27, 29.

BATCH FILE

      You need to write a batch file to call HS/Link.  You only need one batch
file to use HS/Link for one-way OR two-way transfers.  You need to know a few
things to create this batch file.  The first thing is your upload directory
which can be determined by looking in the configuration of your communications
software.  My upload directory is the same as my download directory; C:\TEMP\
and is defined in my Telix configuration.  You might not need to have an
upload directory depending on your communications software but it is usually a
good idea to have one (if you don't have an upload directory, use the same
directory as your download directory).  The second thing you need to know is
the complete path to HSLINK.EXE which was included in the HS/Link archive. 
The last thing you need to know is what your communications program sends to
batch files as: %1, %2, %3, %4, %5, %6, %7, %8, and %9.  You may need to post
a message asking if anybody know what these values are for your particular
communications software.  The values that Telix uses are:

%1 - Baud Rate
%2 - COM Port
%3 - ULDIR\FILENAME.1
%4 - FILENAME.2
%5 - FILENAME.3
%6 - FILENAME.4
%7 - FILENAME.5
%8 - FILENAME.6
%9 - FILENAME.7

      As you can see, you are limited to 7 upload filenames at a time but you
can use wildcards to get more usually.  Telix v3.15 and lower does not put the
entire path the upload filename on the 2nd through 9th upload filenames and
that is why you need to know what you upload directory is defined as.
      Now you are ready to create HSLINK.BAT which is the single batch file
that is needed to use HS/Link.  To create a batch file, use a text editor or
type
"COPY CON HSLINK.BAT" if you do not have a text editor.  The batch file should
look like this for Telix and similar (possibly exactly alike) for other
communications software:

@echo off
C:
cd\TEMP
C:\TELIX\HSLINK\HSLINK -P%2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
if errorlevel 1 pause

      That is exactly how my batch file looks.  The second line goes to the
drive that my upload directory is on.  The third line changes to my upload
directory.  The fourth line contains the complete path to HSLINK.EXE and is
followed by the COM port option (it is good to defined the COM port through
the batch file because if you just put %3 through %9 after HSLINK and you only
wanted to download, the batch file would call HSLINK.EXE with nothing after it
which brings up a help screen).  You should modify this batch file according
to your set up.
      This batch file needs to be in your communications software directory or
preferably in a directory that is in your DOS PATH statement.  My PATH
contains C:\BAT and that is where I keep all of my batch files including
HSLINK.BAT.  You should also copy HSLINK.BAT to the directory that HSLINK.EXE
is located just to be sure that the batch file is run and not the executable
file.  The directory that HSLINK.EXE is located does not need to be in your
PATH and I don't recommend putting it in your PATH either.

INSTALLING HS/LINK AS A PROTOCOL

      To use HS/Link as a protocol in your communications software, go to the
section of the configuration of your communications software that is used to
install/configuration protocols.  To do this with Telix, press ALT-O and then
P.
      By pressing A, B, C, or D at this point in Telix, you will be prompted
for a protocol name.  "HS/Link" is probably the best choice.  After you press
Enter you will be prompted for an Upload Filename.  Enter "HSLINK" or
"HSLINK.BAT" for this blank and also for the Download Filename blank.  Telix
will then ask if the files are Telix Script Language or batch files.  The
answer is (yep, you guessed it) batch files.  You also do not want Telix to
prompt for Download Filenames either.
      If you communications software is not like this in some way, post a
message asking if anybody knows how to install protocols with your
communications software.  It is very likely that somebody will know.

CONCLUSION

      Well, that's all folks!  To use HS/Link, call a BBS that supports
HS/Link.  Add any files that you want to download to a batch queue (or with
software such as PCBoard, you can use "DB" or "D" if HS/Link is available) and
then start the download on the BBS.  Then start an upload on your end (press
PageUp or ALT-S with Telix) and select any files that you want to upload.  If
everything goes right, you will get a total CPS of over 450!
      I strongly recommend registering HS/Link.  It is a great program and I
guarantee that you will use it a lot once you install it.  This program gets
excellent support from its author and new improved versions are constantly
being released.  Samuel Smith has done a great job and should be compensated
for it.  And besides, that closing screen is annoying!
      If you have any questions or comments for the author, consult the
HS/Link Documentation.  If you have any questions, comments, suggestions,
additions, corrections, etc. for me, I can be reached at (517)546-3783 VOICE
and am also a user on all of the BBSs in Livingston County (Michigan).  In
case I cannot be reached in one of those ways, my address is:

      903 W. Grand River
      Howell, MI 48843

      Thank you for reading my instructions.  This protocol will benefit you
as well as myself and other BBS users because it will increase the amount of
uploading which is good for everybody!
