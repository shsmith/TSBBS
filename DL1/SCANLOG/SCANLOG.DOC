This program is a utility for use with the HSLINK file transfer
protocol.  It scans a DSZLOG-style transfer log and returns ERRORLEVELS
corresponding to either the number of successful incoming files, the
number of successful outgoing files, the number of aborted incoming
files, or the number of aborted outgoing files.  This information can be
used in BATCH files to perform different actions depending on the
results of a bidirectional protocol.


                                 USAGE

   scanlog LOGFILE -I
     Sets ERRORLEVEL to the number of completed Incoming files

   scanlog LOGFILE -O
     Sets ERRORLEVEL to the number of completed Outgoing files

   scanlog LOGFILE -R
     Sets ERRORLEVEL to the number of aborted incoming files

   scanlog LOGFILE -T
     Sets ERRORLEVEL to the number of aborted outgoing files
