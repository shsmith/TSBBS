                              DOS HS/LINK REGISTRATION

     THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FREE!  You are allowed to use HS/LINK for a trial
     period of 30 days free of charge. If, after 30 days, you decide that you
     will continue using HS/LINK, you must pay for the program by registering
     it with the author.  OTHERWISE YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE OF THE PROGRAM.

     Each HS/LINK registration is valid for use on a single CPU or on a single
     BBS system (multi-node systems require only a single registration).

     The basic HS/LINK registration cost is $15 US.  You will receive a
     printed registration certificate showing your personal Serial Number and
     Password as well as instructions to "register" both current and future
     updates of the shareware version of HS/LINK.

     A very nice professionally printed and bound reference guide is
     available for $8 per copy.

     For $20 US, a disk containing the latest version of HS/LINK, along
     with a registration certificate can be obtained.

     Be sure to add the correct shipping and handling charges for any disks
     or manuals you are ordering.

     All orders are shipped by First Class Mail or International Air Mail.

     You can also register HS/Link with an Authorized HS/Link Distributor.
     Refer to DISTRIB.DOC for a distributor near you.
