     Installation: 

     Please refer to the GT POWER manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  The following installation
     steps should work for most folks:

     Copy the provided HSRX.BAT and HSTX.BAT files, as well as
     HSLINK.EXE into your GT POWER directory, or into a directory
     included in your search PATH.

     You can edit HSRX.BAT and HSTX.BAT to include options on the HSLINK
     command line, but most folks won't need to change anything.  If you
     want to experiment, there are a number of optional parameters you
     can read about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.

     Next you need to install the HS/LINK protocol into the GT POWER
     protocol menu.

     Load up GT POWER and press ALT-I to get into the CONFIGURE menu.  Then
     enter 6 to access EXTERNAL PROTOCOLS.  In
     this screen, you press 6 (7, 8 or 9 if you already have other
     external protocols configured).
     When asked for "PROTOCOL NAME" enter "HS/Link".
     When asked for "BAT file" enter "HS".
     When asked for "MENU CHAR" enter "H".
     When asked for "BATCH XFER" enter "Y".
     When asked for "TWO WAY" enter "N".
     When asked for "OVER LAY" enter "N".
     Then press ESCAPE twice get out of the configuration mode.

     To download with HS/LINK, first you tell the BBS you're talking to
     what files you want to download, and that you want to download in
     the HS/LINK protocol.  On the Tool Shop you can do this with the
     following command:
        D H filename filename S
     for example,
        D H TOOLSHOP.EXE S

     Once you've got the BBS into downloading mode, you press the PGDN
     key and select the HS/LINK protocol from the menu.

     If you want to also upload to the BBS while downloading, you simply
     press the PGUP key instead of PGDN, select HS/LINK from the menu,
     and list the upload filenames you want to have transmitted.

I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
responsibility for anydamages resulting from these instructions.  If you
get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come with GT POWER
and with HSLINK.  If all else fails, call up the tool shop and ask for
help on the main board.  Either I will help you, or somebody else will
know the answer and give you a hand.

Good luck!
