Beginning with Revision 5.30 of OpusComm, there is internal support
for the 16550A UART chip.  This means that those of you that have the
chip installed no longer need to run the 16550.EXE program to enable
its special features.  OpusComm uses the chip in fully buffered mode
(with more buffering than was allowed with the 16550.EXE program).
