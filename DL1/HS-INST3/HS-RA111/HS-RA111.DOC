                  INSTALLING HS/LINK EXTERNAL PROTOCOL
                    IN RemoteAccess BBS VERSION 1.11

     Please refer to the RemoteAccess manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  This information was tested
     with HS/Link betas posted on 11/19/91 after 3:45PM and RemoteAccess
     version 1.11.

     The following installation steps should work for most folks:

     Place a copy of HSLINK.EXE into your main C:\RA directory.

     Run RACONFIG.EXE and cursor over to MISC and press ENTER.
     Cursor down to PROTOCOLS and press ENTER.
     Press the INS key to insert a new protocol.

     The definition of the HS/Link should look like this:

     The *P is Remote Access's way of passing the comport number to the
     protocol. The *0 set's the path of the protocol to the current file
     area.

     For the program to be able to update file counters and logging
     statistics, it is imperative that the "Log file" be set to the
     Opus compatible log filename. If you already have installed external
     protocols that use this type logging, you need only put in the path to
     that log file. If this is the first, you need to set a pointer in your
     Autoexec.bat that points to the path you insert under "Log File" in the
     external protocol setup. e.g. (Put this in your autoexec.bat if you want
     to use the example given above: SET DSZLOG=C:\RA\DSZ.LOG
     The bi-directional transfers only work when the Download command is
     used because you cannot request files to be received.  You may want
     to explain to your users that they will need to describe any files
     they upload while downloading AFTER the transfer is completed.

     Note for systems running locked COM ports:
     We have found that if you use a locked DTE of 9600 or above, you
     will need to have a NS16550AN UART installed.  Also, for rock solid
     performance you should add the -HS (Handshake Slow) switch to your
     'Download cmd' and 'Upload cmd' configuration lines.

     This should get you set up in under 10 minutes.

     You can edit the 'Download cmd' and 'Upload cmd' configuration
     lines to include options on the HSLINK command line, but most folks
     won't need to change anything.  If your system can't keep up with
     the COM port while accessing the disk drive, you may want to add
     -HS to both lines.  If you want to experiment, there are a number
     of optional parameters you can read about in HSLINK.DOC and
     HSLINK.NEW.

     I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
     responsibility for any damages resulting from these instructions.
     If you get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come
     with RemoteAccess and with HS/Link.  If all else fails, call up the
     Tool Shop and ask for help on the Support Conference.  Either I
     will help you, or somebody else will know the answer and give you a
     hand.

     Good luck!
