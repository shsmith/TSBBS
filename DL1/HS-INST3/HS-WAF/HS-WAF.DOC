        The files in this archive should be added to the end of the files 
        in the /waffke/extern directory bearing their names.  Then, edit 
        your /waffle/menus/protocol menu to reflect that you added 
        HS/LINK.  Copy the HS/LINK program into your /waffle/bin directo-
        ry or wherever you nomrally keep your protocols.  If that direc-
        tory is not on the search path, edit the _send and _receive files 
        to reflect that.
        
        Presently, there is no way within Waffle to cope with bidirec-
        tional transfers, or batch transfers for that matter.  You might 
        want to use the -NU option to disallow bidirectional transfers, 
        or if you want to receive uploads anyway, slect an upload direc-
        tory on the command line, or point to a configruation file you've 
        created and want to use if HSLINK.EXE is not on your search path.
        
        Good luck!
