                            IN PCBOARD 14.5
        (REFER TO HS-145A FOR INSTALLATION UNDER PCBOARD 14.5A)
 
                                  
     Please refer to the PCBOARD manual and change HISTORY for detailed
     information on installation of external protocols.  This
     information was tested with HSLINK betas posted on 10/30/91 and
     PCBOARD 14.5.  PCBoard 14.5 does not fully support HS/Link, so it
     is recommended that you upgrade to PCBoard 14.5A.

     The following installation steps should work for most folks:

     Copy the provided PCBSH.BAT and PCNRH.BAT files into your \PCB
     system directory.  On a multi-node system, copy these files into
     the \PCB directory for each node.  Copy HSLINK.EXE into directory
     included in your search PATH.

     You can edit PCBSH.BAT and PCBRH.BAT to include options on the
     HSLINK command line, but most folks won't need to change anything.
     If your system can't keep up with the COM port while accessing the
     disk drive, you may want to add -HS to the command line in each
     file.  If you want to experiment, there are a number of optional
     parameters you can read about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.

     Contents of PCBSH.BAT
     ---------------------
         echo off
         if exist pcberr.fil del pcberr.fil
         if exist %DSZLOG% del %DSZLOG%
         hslink -hs -p%1 -e%5 -nu %3
                 |
                 +---- this was added if you need slow handshake

     Contents of PCBRH.BAT
     ---------------------
         echo off
         if exist pcberr.fil del pcberr.fil
         if exist %DSZLOG% del %DSZLOG%
         hslink -hs -p%1 -e%5 -u%3
                 |
                 +---- this was added if you need slow handshake
     
     Next you need to install the HS/LINK protocol into the PCBOARD
     protocol menu.  There are two ways to do this.

     The easiest is to edit your \PCB\GEN\PCBPROT.DAT file in text
     editor and add the following line:
        H,D,1024,HS/Link (batch),N,N,Y

     If you prefer to use PCBSETUP, the following steps will give the
     same result.

     Load up PCBSETUP and press C to access the FILE LOCATIONS 2 screen.
     Then cursor down to the PROTOCOL DATA FILE and press F2.
     In this screen you press ALT-I to insert a new protocol.
     When asked for "USE" enter "H".
     When asked for "TYPE" enter "B".
     When asked for "SIZE" enter "1024".
     When asked for "MNP" enter "N".
     When asked for "PORT OPEN" enter "N".
     When asked for "LOCK LINES" enter "Y".

     You should see the protocol defined like this:
       ษออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออป

       บ                         Edit Protocol File                         บ
       บ                                                                    บ
       บ                   Port Lock                                        บ
       บ Use Type Size MNP Open Lines             Protocol Description      ฑ

       บ  H   D   1024  N   N     Y   HS/Link (batch)                       ฑ
       บ                                                                    บ

     Press ESC to exit this screen.
     When asked "SAVE CHANGES" press "Y" and ENTER.
     Press ESC two more times to exit the setup program.
     When asked "SAVE Y/N/Q/A" press "Q" and ENTER.


I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
responsibility for anydamages resulting from these instructions.  If you
get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come with PCBOARD
and with HSLINK.  If all else fails, call up the tool shop and ask for
help on the main board.  Either I will help you, or somebody else will
know the answer and give you a hand.

Good luck!
