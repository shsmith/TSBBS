     Installation: 

     Please refer to the QMODEM manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  The following installation
     steps should work for most folks:

     Copy the provided HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT files, as well as
     HSLINK.EXE into your QMODEM directory, or into a directory included
     in your search PATH.

     You can edit HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT to include options on the HSLINK
     command line, but most folks won't need to change anything.  If you
     want to experiment, there are a number of optional parameters you
     can read about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.  The first thing you
     might want to do is add a -Udrive:\path statement to direct your
     downloads to your download directory, instead of having them placed
     into the current directory.

     Next you need to install the HS/LINK protocol into the QMODEM
     protocol menu.

     Load up QMODEM and press ALT-N to get into the CONFIGURE menu.  Then
     cursor over to the PROTOCOLS selection and press ENTER.  In this
     screen, you press 0 (1, or 2 if you already have other external
     protocols configured).
     Set the "Select Character" to "H".
     Set the "Protocol" to "HS/Link".
     Set the "Upload BAT" to "HS-U.BAT".
     Set the "Download BAT" to "HS-D.BAT".
     Set "Download Filename Prompt" to "N".
     Then press ESCAPE to get out of this screen and cursor over to EXIT
     and choose "WRITE CHANGES TO DISK" and press ENTER to save your
     changes.

     To download with HS/LINK, first you tell the BBS you're talking to
     what files you want to download, and that you want to download in
     the HS/LINK protocol.  On the Tool Shop you can do this with the
     following command:
        D H filename filename S
     for example,
        D H TOOLSHOP.EXE S

     Once you've got the BBS into downloading mode, you press the PGDN
     key and press "H" to select the HS/LINK protocol from the menu.

     If you want to also upload to the BBS while downloading, you simply
     press the PGUP key instead of PGDN, select HS/LINK from the menu,
     and list the upload filenames you want to have transmitted.

I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
responsibility for anydamages resulting from these instructions.  If you
get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come with QMODEM
and with HSLINK.  If all else fails, call up the tool shop and ask for
help on the main board.  Either I will help you, or somebody else will
know the answer and give you a hand.

Good luck!
