                  INSTALLING HS/LINK EXTERNAL PROTOCOL
                           IN Virtual BBS 5.4

     Please refer to the RemoteAccess manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  This information was tested
     with HS/Link version 1.00 and Virtual BBS version 5.40.

     Virtual BBS version 5.4 comes pre-installed for HS/Link.  Follow
     these instructions if you wish to verify HS/Link installation, or
     to make changes.  It also adds a single direction "upload" mode for
     HS/Link.

     Place a copy of HSLINK.EXE into your main C:\VBBS directory, or
     some other directory in your PATH list.

     Run VCONFIG.EXE and press 6 for DOWNLOAD PROTOCOLS.

     The download definition of the HS/Link should look like this:

  [DOWNLOAD PROTOCOLS]

  Key Name                     Command Line (download protocols) (*=batch)
  --- ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------
  *H  HSLINK (Bidirectional)   HSLINK -p%1 -e%2 -UC:\VBBS\SYSOP %3

     In place of C:\VBBS\SYSOP substitute your own upload directory, if
     you use a different name for it.

     The bi-directional transfers only work when the Download command is
     used because you cannot request files to be received.  You may want
     to explain to your users that they will need to describe any files
     they upload while downloading AFTER the transfer is completed.

     Return to the main menu of VCONFIG and select 7 for UPLOAD
     PROTOCOLS.

  [UPLOAD PROTOCOLS]

  Key Name                     Command Line (upload protocols) (*=batch)
  --- ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------
  *H  HSLINK                   HSLINK -p%1 -e%2 -u%3

     Note for systems running locked COM ports:
     We have found that if you use a locked DTE of 9600 or above, you
     will need to have a NS16550AN UART installed.  Also, for rock solid
     performance you should add the -HS (Handshake Slow) switch to your
     upload and download command lines.

     This should get you set up in under 10 minutes.

     You can edit the download and upload command lines to include
     options on the HSLINK command line, but most folks won't need to
     change anything.  If your system can't keep up with the COM port
     while accessing the disk drive, you may want to add -HS to both
     lines.  If you want to experiment, there are a number of optional
     parameters you can read about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.

     I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
     responsibility for any damages resulting from these instructions.
     If you get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come
     with RemoteAccess and with HS/Link.  If all else fails, call up the
     Tool Shop and ask for help on the Support Conference.  Either I
     will help you, or somebody else will know the answer and give you a
     hand.

     Good luck!
