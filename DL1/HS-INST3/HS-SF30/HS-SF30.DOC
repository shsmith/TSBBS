                  INSTALLING HS/LINK EXTERNAL PROTOCOL
                      IN SPITFIRE BBS VERSION 3.0

     Please refer to the SPITFIRE manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  This information was tested
     with HS/Link betas posted on 11/19/91 and SPITFIRE version 3.0.

     The following installation steps should work for most folks:

     SPITFIRE allows several different external protocols, which must be
     lettered sequentially starting with A.  If HS/Link is the first
     external protocol you install, it will be letter A.  If it is the
     second external protocol, it will be B, and so forth.  In this
     document we will assume that HS/Link is the first external protocol
     to be installed.  If you already have other external protocols
     installed, you will need to change the batch file names
     accordingly.  Refer to the spitfire manual chapter 18 for more
     details on this subject.

     Load up spitfire and press ALT-P.

     Check that "<A> External Transfer Protocols" is set to YES.

     Check that "<D> Display Files Path" is set to C:\SF\DISPLAY.

     Check that "<E> External Transfer Path" is set to C:\SF\EXTNOD1. If
     you change this setting you will have to make changes in the
     provided batch files.

     Place a copy of HSLINK.EXE into C:\SF\EXTNOD1.  Also copy the
     supplied SFEXTDNA.BAT and SFEXTUPA.BAT files into the C:\SF\EXTNOD1
     directory.  Note that these files must be renamed if you already
     have other external protocols installed.

     Use a text editor to edit or create the file
     C:\SF\DISPLAY\SFEXTDN.BBS. Insert the following line into this
     file:
        <A> HS/Link,BATCH

     Use a text editor to edit or create the file
     C:\SF\DISPLAY\SFEXTUP.BBS. Insert the following line into this
     file:
        <A> HS/Link,BATCH

     This should get you set up in under 10 minutes.

     Note for systems running locked COM ports:
     We have found that if you use a locked DTE of 9600 or above, you
     will need to have a NS16550AN UART installed.  Also, for rock solid
     performance you should add the -HS (Handshake Slow) switch to your
     'SFEXTDNA.BAT' and 'SFEXTUPA.BAT' batch files.

     You can edit SFEXTDNA.BAT and SFEXTUPA.BAT to include options on
     the HSLINK command line, but most folks won't need to change
     anything. If your system can't keep up with the COM port while
     accessing the disk drive, you may want to add -HS to the command
     line in each file. If you want to experiment, there are a number of
     optional parameters you can read about in HSLINK.DOC and
     HSLINK.NEW.

     I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
     responsibility for any damages resulting from these instructions.
     If you get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come
     with SPITFIRE and with HS/Link.  If all else fails, call up the
     Tool Shop and ask for help on the Support Conference.  Either I
     will help you, or somebody else will know the answer and give you a
     hand.

     Good luck!
