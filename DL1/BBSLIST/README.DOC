BBSLIST is a DOOR program for PCBoard and ProDoor/ProLogon systems.  It
is used to allow your users to build and update a listing of bulletin
board systems.  The listing can be purged automatically to remove
entries not recently updated.


                                 FILES
                                 -----

BBSLIST	
        This is the door script for BBSLIST.  This door needs
        PCBOARD.SYS only.  Edit this file to specify the directory where
        BBSLIST has been installed.

BBSLIST.CFG
        Configuration file. See internal comments for details.

BBSLIST.EXE
	This is the main BBSLIST program.

BBSLIST.INT
        This is the introductory text message given to users on entry to
        the door.

EVENT.BAT
        This batch file can be called in your event to sort and update
        the current listing, and to purge older entries.

UPDATE.BAT
        Similar to EVENT.BAT but used interactively during the day to
        post recent entries.

BBSLIST.DAT
        This is the BBSLIST database.  This is a text file with fixed
        positions in each line.  If you are careful, you can edit this
        in a text editor, but be sure you don't change the spacing!

QSORT.EXE
        The sample batch files call QSORT to sort the BBSLIST data file.
        You can obtain this program from most boards.


                               OPERATION
                               ---------

Door operation is fully automatic, and should require no manual work
from the sysop.  If you desire to modify existing entries, I find it
easiest to use a text editor (such as Qedit) to directly edit the
BBSLIST.DAT file.  This allows you to edit text and erase unwanted
entries as needed.  Just be careful to keep the INSERT mode turned OFF
so you don't change the spacing of fields.

When you login to the door with a userlevel of 110 or higher, it will
prompt you to "select user name".  This allows the sysop to access and
edit entries from any user on the system, and to entry multiple entries
under different names.


                                SUPPORT
                                -------

Sorry, no time to document this any further!  Use at your own risk.
Perhaps I will write a proper instruction for this door if there is any
interest shown in it.

                            REVISION HISTORY
                            ----------------
7/13/93
        Initial version, written for my own use to maintain the HS/Link
        bbs list.

8/3/93
        Corrected logic to properly create a new BBSLIST.DAT file the
        first time the door is used.

8/17/93
        Changed the minimum "sysop" level from 111 to 110.
        Added a way for users to delete existing entries from the list.

8/19/93
        Added logic to automatically post a Main Board message to users
        when a listing entry is purged due to age.
