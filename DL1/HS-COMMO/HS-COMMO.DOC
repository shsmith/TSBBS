 
                   USING COMMO WITH EXTERNAL HS/LINK
 
                                  
     Installation: 

     HS/Link comes pre-installed in recent versions of COMMO.  The
     following instructions are needed only if you wish to modify the
     installation.

     Please refer to the COMMO manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  The following installation
     steps should work if you're familiar with editing the COMMO setup
     and macro files.

     Copy HSLINK.EXE into your COMMO directory, or into a directory
     included in your search PATH.

     Use a text editor to modify the file COMMO.SET.  Add the following
     line to enable HS/Link autodownloading:
                 {aut=hslink,^bR}       Auto Receive, HS/Link

     Use a text editor to modify the file COMMO.MAC.  Add the following
     line to the UPLOAD menu section:

 º                   HS/Link              using HSLINK.EXE                    º {goto hsul}

     Remember to include the text beyond column 80!.   Now add this line
     to the DOWNLOAD menu section:

 º                   HS/Link              using HSLINK.EXE                    º {goto hslink}

     Next, add this line to the table of download protocol macros:

 HS/Link  {:hsul} {call gfnu} {exec HSLINK -p%_por %file} {}        HSLINK.EXE

     Finally, add this line to the table of upload protocol macros:

 HS/Link   {:hslink}  {exec HSLINK -p%_por -u%dldir} {}             HSLINK.EXE

     If you made all the changes correctly, you might have a working
     installation of HS/Link in COMMO.  Since these edits are a bit
     tricky, I have included sample COMMO.SET and COMMO.MAC files for
     you to examine and/or use, but remember the files might need other
     changes for your specific system and modem configuration.

     To download with HS/LINK, just you tell the BBS you're talking to
     what files you want to download, and that you want to download in
     the HS/LINK protocol.  On the Tool Shop you can do this with the
     following command:
        D H filename filename S
     for example,
        D H TOOLSHOP.EXE S

     Once you've got the BBS into downloading mode, COMMO will
     automatically detect HS/Link and will call up the HSLINK.EXE
     program to handle it.

     If you want to upload to the BBS while downloading, have to be
     quick to press PGUP before the autodownload sequence is detected.
     Then cursor down to HS/Link in the menu and hit enter.  Specify the
     files to upload and press ENTER again.  

I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take respons-
ibility for any damages resulting from these instructions.  If you get
stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come with COMMO and
with HSLINK.  If all else fails, call up the tool shop and ask for help
on the main board.  Either I will help you, or somebody else will know
the answer and give you a hand.

Good luck!
