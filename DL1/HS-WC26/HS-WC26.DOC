                  INSTALLING HS/LINK EXTERNAL PROTOCOL
                 IN WILDCAT! BBS TEST DRIVE VERSION 2.6

     Please refer to the WILDCAT! manual for detailed information on
     installation of external protocols.  This information was tested
     with WILDCAT! test drive version 2.61S.

     The following installation steps should work for most folks:

     Run MAKEWILD.EXE to set your wildcat configuration options.

     On page 'General Information - Part 1' line 11, add 1 to the number
     of external protocols.  If this is your first external protocol,
     set this entry to '1'.

     On page 'External Protocol Definition' enter the following
     information for HS/Link:

     On page 'Node Information' line 4 set the Path for External
     Protocols to C:\WILDCAT\EP.  Note that if you use a different
     directory here you must also edit the CD statements in HS-U.BAT and
     HS-D.BAT to reflect your system.

     Place a copy of HSLINK.EXE into your protocol directory,
     C:\WILDCAT\EP.  Also copy the supplied HS-U.BAT and HS-D.BAT files
     into the C:\WILDCAT\EP directory.

     This should get you set up in under 10 minutes.

     Wildcat 2.6 does not support batch uploads, nor does it support
     bidirectional transfers.  If the caller attempts to upload multiple
     files, or files that do not match the filename given in advance,
     the resulting upload file may be corrupt or misnamed.

     I understand that Mustang software is currently working on a new
     version of Wildcat! which will have these capabilities.  Please
     contact Mustang for upgrade information.

     Note for systems running locked COM ports:
     We have found that if you use a locked DTE of 9600 or above, you
     will need to have a NS16550AN UART installed. Also, for rock solid
     performance you should add the -HS (Handshake Slow) switch to your
     'HS-D.BAT' and 'HS-U.BAT' batch files.

     You can edit HS-D.BAT and HS-U.BAT to include options on the HSLINK
     command line, but most folks won't need to change anything. If your
     system can't keep up with the COM port while accessing the disk
     drive, you may want to add -HS to the command line in each file.
     If you want to experiment, there are a number of optional
     parameters you can read about in HSLINK.DOC and HSLINK.NEW.

     Contents of HS-D.BAT
     --------------------
          CD \WILDCAT\EP
          HSLINK -P%2 -B%1 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
          IF ERRORLEVEL 1 COPY ALL.OK TRANSFER.BAD

     Contents of HS-U.BAT
     --------------------
          CD \WILDCAT\EP
          HSLINK -P%2 -B%1 -U%5

     I hope these instructions help, but remember, I can't take
     responsibility for any damages resulting from these instructions.
     If you get stuck, it always helps to read the DOC files that come
     with Wildcat! and with HS/Link.  If all else fails, call up the
     Tool Shop and ask for help on the Support Conference.  Either I
     will help you, or somebody else will know the answer and give you a
     hand.

     Good luck!
