                              HSLINK 1.0 Registration

     This program is not free!  You are allowed to use this program for a
     trial period of 30 days free of charge.  If, after 30 days, you decide
     that you would like to continue using HSLINK, you must complete the
     following form and return it to the author with the required
     registration fee enclosed.

     Each HSLINK registration is valid for use on a single CPU or on a
     single BBS system (multi-node systems require only a single
     registration).

     Registration also enables a bar-graphic display of file transfer
     status, an estimation of remaining time to transfer each file, and
     a calculation of combined thruput during bidirectional transfers.

     The basic HSLINK registration cost is $20 US, which includes a
     registration certificate showing a Serial Number and Password.
     (The special introductory registration fee of $15 expires 1-feb-92.)

     For $30 US, a 5.25 disk containing the latest release of HSLINK, along
     with a registration certificate can be obtained.

     Add $2 each for 3.5" disks instead of 5.25" disks.

     Printed and bound operation manuals cost $15 each.


                  QUANTITY AND CORPORATE LICENSES

                  LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR SHAREWARE DISTRIBUTORS

     Shareware distributors may distribute this program as long as the
     Author has been notified prior to ANY distribution.  The "per disk"
     charge may not exceed $10 and the shareware distributor will not
     change the above license agreement for the end user of HSLINK.  End
     users are still required to register each shareware copy of HSLINK.
