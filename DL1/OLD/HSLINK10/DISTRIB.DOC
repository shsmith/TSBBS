    Distributors

    The following individuals are valid distributors as of 1/14/92.
    Since the distributorship program is very new, I recommend that you
    call my BBS (The Tool Shop) before purchasing.  Calling will allow
    you to determine if a distributor is still in good standing and if
    there is a new distributor that might be closer to you.  If you
    experience any problems with a particular distributor, please
    contact me immediatelly so that we can get it resolved quickly.
