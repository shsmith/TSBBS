          HS/Link is a high speed, full streaming, bidirectional, batch
          file transfer protocol with advanced Full-Streaming-Error-
          Correction.  Each side of the link is allowed to provide a list
          of files to be sent.  Files will be sent in BOTH directions until
          both sides of the link are satisfied.

          HS/Link is not just another bidirectional protocol, it is also a
          very fast protocol for normal downloading and uploading,
          incorporating some new ideas (such as Full-Streaming-Error-
          Correction and Dynamic-Code-Substitution) to make things happen a
          bit faster and with greater reliability.

          This program is not free!  You are hereby licensed to use this
          program for a trial period of 30 days free of charge.  If, after
          30 days, you decide that you would like to continue using HSLINK,
          you must complete the registration form (REGISTER.FRM) and return
          it to the author with the required registration fee enclosed.

          Registration removes the "UNREGISTERED" message and also enables
          a bar-graphic display of file transfer status, an estimation of
          remaining time to transfer each file, and a calculation of
          combined thruput during bidirectional transfers.

          Please feel free to distribute HSLINK to your friends and local
          BBSes as long as all of the files in this archive are included

                                     Introduction
          _________________________________________________________________

          What is a file transfer protocol?

          A file transfer protocol is a means of transferring information
          from one computer to another.  The protocol has the
          responsibility of protecting against errors in transit, and
          taking measures to correct any errors that are detected.  The
          design and implementation of a protocol can make the difference
          between slow and unreliable communication, and fast and trouble
          free communication.

          Not all protocols are created equal.  With today's high speed
          modems, packet switched networks (such as PC Pursuit), and
          expensive long distance charges, users demand more than ever that
          files get through quickly and without corruption.

          The HS/Link protocol is the result of years of communication
          experience, and uses some very new and solid technology to see to
          it that you can easily move files as quickly as possible, and
          with the least amount of hassle.

          The HSLINK program can be used from the DOS command line, from
          BATCH files, or as an "external protocol" from most modern COMM
          programs and BBS programs.  If your favorite BBS does not yet
          support the HS/Link protocol, please ask your SYSOP to install
          it.

          Recent advances in high speed modem technology have made it
          possible to simultaneously transfer data at high speeds in both
          directions.  This standardized
          technology is called "V.32", and  ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
          is available in many new modems.  ³Bidirectional features that³
          Until HS/Link, these advanced     ³really work...             ³
          modems were left half idle, due   ³HS/Link can simultaneously ³
          to the single-direction nature    ³send and receive files!    ³

          protocols.  The bidirectional
          capabilities of HS/Link take full advantage of these modems,
          cutting online time as much as 50% when equal amounts of data are
          transmitted and received.

                               Summary of Key Features
          _________________________________________________________________

          ù Speed.
               HS/Link operates at or very near peak efficiency, often
               reaching 98% or more with pre-compressed files and non-
               buffered modems.  Even higher speeds are possible with
               buffered or error correcting modems.  A number of features,
               such as fast 32 bit CRC protection, Full-Streaming-Error-
               Recovery and Dynamic-Code-Substitution, combine to give
               maximum performance and security.

          ù Simple interface for beginners.
               In many cases, HS/Link requires only the COM port number and
               the filename to be transmitted.  Configuration files are not
               required.  The program is easily installed in most COMM
               programs that support external protocols.  The HSLINK
               program has multiple help screens, providing a quick
               reference to the basic and advanced command line options,
               including examples of how the program is used.

          ù Batch file transfers.
               The protocol can handle any size batch of files, and can
               take file specifications from either the command line or
               from a listing file.

          ù Bi-directional options that really work.
               The program can simultaneously upload and download with a
               single host request.  What's even better is how easy it is
               to use...  instead of a complex setup all you do is:

               1)   Tell the BBS the names of the files you want to
                    download, and then

               2)   Press PGUP (or whatever your COMM program uses to
                    UPLOAD files) and then tell your COMM program which
                    files to upload

               By virtue of the BBS being told that it is sending files and
               your COMM program telling HS/Link that it too is sending
               files you then have a bidirectional transfer.  There's
               nothing else to set up.  You use the familiar BBS interface
               to request files to download and your COMM program's
               familiar interface to tell it which files to upload.  It
               couldn't get easier!

          ù Aborted file crash recovery.
               When desired, HS/Link can resume an aborted transfer,
               verifying all existing data blocks to insure the resumed
               file completely matches the file being transmitted.  This
               function can also update a file that has only a small number
               of changed, added, or deleted blocks.

                              Full Screen Status Display
          _________________________________________________________________

          When HS/Link is operating, it produces a full screen status
          display.  This display is divided into four windows.  Here is an
          example of a status display:

        Total of 86529 bytes transferred.  Combined thruput 562 cps.

          The first window contains the program identification and
          copyright.  When you register your copy of HSLINK, this window
          will also show the registered serial number.  Some warning
          messages may also appear in this window

          The "settings" window shows a summary of the various parameters
          that can be altered with command line options.

          The "receiver" window shows the status of files being received
          from the remote system.

          The "transmitter" window shows the status of files being
          transmitted to the remote system.

          To stop display bleedthrough under DesqView or DoubleDOS, use the
          -NV option to disable direct video writing.  The result will be a
          slightly slower display, but it will not bleed from one partition
          to another.

          If desired, the full screen status display can be turned off.  To
          do this, use the -NF command line option.  When running in -NF
          mode, a simple line-oriented status display will scroll down the
          screen.  This may be desired under some circumstances.

                                 Command Line Format
          _________________________________________________________________

          To run the HSLINK program, a command line must be given.  The
          command line has the following format:

          HSLINK [options] [SENDFILE] [@DRIVE:\PATH\FILELIST]

          SENDFILE  Indicates a list of files to be transmitted to remote
                    computer.  The list may include the DOS wildcard
                    characters '?' and '*'.  Specify ONLY files to be
                    transmitted; received file names are determined
                    automatically.

          @FILELIST Transmit list of files contained in FILELIST to remote
                    computer.  This is used when you want to make a long
                    list of files in advance, then transmit them all with a
                    single command.  It is also used by BBS programs to
                    produce long batches of downloads.

          ù    Anything shown in brackets "[]" is optional and may not need
               to be specified for proper operation of HS/Link.
          ù    The HSLINK command line is NOT case sensitive, and will work
               when typed in upper, lower or mixed case.
          ù    Please make sure that HSLINK.EXE is in a search PATH
               directory.

                              Basic Command Line Options
          _________________________________________________________________

          The most important command line options are -P (set COM port), -U
          (set download file directory), and -HS (enable slow handshake).

          -Pport    This option specifies which COM port you are using.
                    Example:  -P2

          -Udir     This option controls the destination directory for
                    downloaded files.  Without this option, all download
                    files are placed into the current directory.
                    Example:  -Uc:\bbsfiles

          -HS       Handshake Slow (send XOFF and/or lower RTS during disk
                    I/O).  This option may be required if your computer is
                    unable to simultaneously access the disk and the COM
                    port.  If you see frequent CRC error messages, even on
                    clean phone lines, you probably need to include -HS in
                    your command line.

          To abort an HS/Link transfer, press Control-X four or more times.

                                 Configuration Files
          _________________________________________________________________

          Because of the large number of possible command line options, it
          is possible to store frequently used command options in a
          configuration file.  This
          eliminates the need to            ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
          repeatedly type the options at a  ³HS/Link does NOT require³
          command line.  If you are         ³configuration files.    ³
          calling HSLINK from multiple      ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
          batch files, you can also use
          configuration files to store "common" options, that can be
          changed in one place rather than separately in the various batch
          files.

          HSLINK will search the current
          directory and then the PATH       ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
          directories for HSLINK.CFG.  If   ³For best results, add your ³
          this file is found, each file     ³HS/Link or COMM program    ³
          line is loaded as a command line  ³directory to your PATH     ³
          option.                           ³statement.                 ³
                                            ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


          If you want to use an alternate configuration file, use the
          -@fname command line option, which will cause 'fname' to be
          loaded.  For example:
               HSLINK -@C:\WORK\TOLAP.CFG
          will cause HSLINK to use C:\WORK\TOLAP.CFG as the configuration
          file.


          If -@fname is not the first command line option, the default
          HSLINK.CFG file will be searched for and loaded before the
          specified configuration file.


          Use -@ (without a filename) to prevent HSLINK from searching for
          a configuration file, slightly speeding operation on systems that
          have a long search PATH setting in effect.

          HSLINK includes the HS/Link Configuration Manager program,
          HSCONFIG.EXE.  With this program you can easily manipulate most
          of HS/Link's many options.

          HSCONFIG can be used to edit any configuration file, but the
          default is to edit HSLINK.CFG in the current directory.  If you
          want to edit some other configuration file, you must specify the
          filename on the HSCONFIG command line.  For example:

               HSCONFIG TOLAP.CFG

          will create or edit TOLAP.CFG, which can later be used by HSLINK
          with a command line like this:

               HSLINK -@TOLAP.CFG

          The primary screen in HSCONFIG is the "Basic Settings" screen,
          which controls the most important settings for HS/Link operation. 
          The other screens contain advanced settings that need not be

                            Advanced Command Line Options
          _________________________________________________________________

          The HS/Link protocol program has a number of command line
          options, most of which are rarely needed, or which are provided
          for advanced users to obtain maximum performance and flexibility.

          -@fname
               Uses fname as an alternate configuration file.  Each line in
               the specified file may contain a single command line option. 
               The default is to search PATH directories for HSLINK.CFG.

          -!
               Take priority.  Locally specified -A, -HX, -S, and -W
               settings will be used by the remote system.

          -A
               Disable transmission of ACK codes after each block.  This
               may improve transfer speeds under some conditions.

          -Bbaud
               COM port opening baud rate   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
               300-115200 (default=current  ³Don't use the -B option if ³
               port OPEN speed).            ³you don't need to!  In most³
               This option controls the     ³cases HS/Link is able to   ³
               speed at which the COM port  ³automatically determine the³

                                            ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
               Normally, the COM port
               speed can be determined from hardware and need not be
               specified.

          -C
               Disable carrier detect checking.

          -CBcolor
               Defines the border color in full screen mode.

          -CMcolor
               Defines the main screen color in full screen mode.

          -CTcolor
               Defines the window title color in full screen mode.

          -CWcolor
               Defines the window contents color in full screen mode.

          -Ebaud
               Effective modem-to-modem baud rate.
               This is used to estimate transfer times, and is included in
               the DSZLOG output.  (default=current -B setting)

          -HC
               Disables CTS hardware handshake.
               CTS transmitter handshake is automatically enabled, but may
               conflict with some unusual modem cables or serial ports.  If
               the CTS signal is not active when HSLINK loads, it will
               automatically disable CTS handshake for you.  Use the -HC
               command to manually disable CTS handshake.

          -HR
               Disables RTS hardware handshake.
               RTS receiver handshake is used when the slow-handshake
               option is selected.  This form of handshake causes the RTS
               line to the modem to be lowered whenever the disk is being
               accessed.  Some unusual modem or cable arrangements may not
               tolerate the RTS line being lowered.  In this case, the RTS
               handshake can be disabled with the -HR option.

          -HS
               Handshake Slow (send XOFF and/or lower RTS during disk I/O).
               The slow handshake option is available for systems with slow
               disk access.  Use this if you get frequent CRC errors or COM
               Overrun errors on otherwise clean lines.  The slow handshake
               option causes XOFF to be sent and/or RTS to be lowered
               during any disk activity.  Even when -HS is active, the
               HS/Link protocol should transfer data very nearly as fast as
               the slowest part of the link allows.

          -HX
               Disable XON/XOFF handshake.
               XON/XOFF handshake is a software handshake scheme that
               should work well on all combinations of modems and networks,
               and is enabled by default.  If you prefer not to use
               XON/XOFF handshake, or you find that it is not required for
               error-free transfer, you can disable it with the -HX option.

               Note that both the sender and the receiver must
               simultaneously disable XON/XOFF handshake, otherwise it will
               remain in effect.

          -Iidle
               This option controls how idle time is given up under
               multitasking environments.  The possible values are:
                    -I0  Default, do not give up idle time
                    -I1  Spend idle time checking keyboard status
                    -I2  Give up idle time under DesqView
                    -I3  Give up idle time under DoubleDOS

          -K
               Keep partial files from aborted transfers.

          -O
               Allow receive files to overwrite existing files.

          -NB
               Disable buffering of receive and transmit files.

          -NC
               Disable Dynamic Code Substitution logic.
               Certain byte codes cannot be transmitted directly over the
               COM link. For instance, the codes for Control-X, Control-S
               and Control-Q must be "escaped" to prevent a conflict with
               flow or program control.

               The HS/Link protocol uses a new Dynamic Code Substitution
               system to drastically reduce the number protocol overhead
               and "escape" codes needed to transmit certain data streams.

               Highly compressed data files (such as ZIP and GIF files)
               benefit the most, since they often have many byte codes that
               cannot be transmitted directly over the COM link.

               This option bypasses the
               full screen display and causes a line-oriented output to be
               used.  Use this option if your environment's screen
               management does not allow a full-screen display.

          -NM
               Enable Minimal Blocks logic.  Use with caution.

          -NT
               Stamp current file time.   This option stamps the current
               time/date on received files, instead of retaining the
               original file time/date.

          -NU
               Block uploads.   This option is used by BBS programs that
               cannot (yet) cope with bidirectional uploads.  It is used in
               place of the -U option on the 'download' command line, and
               has the effect of blocking any simultaneous upload requests
               from a user.

          -NV
               Disable direct Video for     ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
               DesqView/DoubleDOS/etc.      ³You may need to use -NV  ³
               Use this option if you       ³to stop display bleeding.³

               the status display from one

               stop "COM Overrun" error conditions.

          -PIirq
               Set non-standard COM port IRQ level to 1-7.  This option
               must be used when -PB is used.

          -R
               Resume aborted transfer.     ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
               The receiver and             ³Use -R -K -O if you want³

               transmission at the first block that does not match.  This
               provides a reliable means of restarting an aborted transfer,
               or of updating a modified file.  You must also use -O to

                                   BBS Requirements
          _________________________________________________________________

          HS/Link's demands on a bulletin board program are extremely easy
          to fill.  The following is all that is necessary:

          1)   The protocol accepts either
               a filename to download or a  ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
               list of files of the form    ³Send file lists are text³
               @DRIVE:\PATH\DOWNLIST.LST.   ³files that contain one  ³
               The protocol will send only  ³path/filename per line. ³
               the specified files if       ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
               filenames (without leading
               @) are given, or all of the
               files found in C:\BBS\DOWNLIST.LST if @C:\BBS\DOWNLIST.LST
               is specified.

          2)   The protocol will create a DSZLOG compatible log file
               indicating the names of all files transferred as well as
               their status (refer to the DSZ standard and the "DSZLOG
               Statistic Logging" section for the specific contents of the
               file).

          3)   Any files found in the
               DSZLOG file which BBS did    ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
               not tell the protocol to     ³HS/Link does NOT modify  ³

               instead been RECEIVED by     ³The BBS program must     ³
               the protocol.  The BBS       ³detect uploads and do    ³

               descriptions and post them in the upload directory.


          If the BBS program is not yet
          able to cope with bidirectional   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
          uploads, the -NU option can be    ³Use -NU to block all  ³

                                     Flow Control
          _________________________________________________________________

          Flow Control is required when the sending and receiving computers
          or modems operate at different speeds, or when computers are
          unable to simultaneously access disk drives and the COM port. 
          Flow Control is a software and/or hardware means of slowing down
          the faster parts of the connection to prevent overloading the
          slower parts of the system.

          HS/Link uses both XON/XOFF (software) and RTS/CTS (hardware)
          handshake when communicating with high speed modems or slow
          packet switched networks.  The protocol also uses a window
          algorithm to suspend data transmission if the receiver does not
          eventually respond to transmitted data.

          XON/XOFF handshake is a software handshake scheme that should
          work well on all combinations of modems and networks, and is
          enabled by default.  If you prefer not to use XON/XOFF handshake,
          or you find that it is not required for error-free transfer, you
          can disable it with the -HX option.  Note that both the sender
          and the receiver must simultaneously disable XON/XOFF handshake,
          otherwise it will remain in effect.

          The slow handshake option (-HS) is available for systems with
          slow disk access.  Use this if you get frequent CRC errors or COM
          Overrun errors on otherwise clean lines.  The slow handshake
          option causes XOFF to be sent
          and/or RTS to be lowered during   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
          any disk activity.  Even when     ³The -HS option stops most  ³
          -HS is active, the HS/Link        ³Overrun and CRC errors that³
          protocol should transfer data     ³occur during or immediately³
          very nearly as fast as the        ³after disk I/O takes place.³
          slowest part of the link allows.  ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

          CTS transmitter handshake is automatically enabled, but may
          conflict with some unusual modem cables or serial ports.  If the
          CTS signal is not active when HSLINK loads, it will automatically
          disable CTS handshake for you.  Use the -HC command to manually
          disable CTS handshake.

          RTS receiver handshake is used when the slow-handshake option is
          selected.  This form of handshake causes the RTS line to the
          modem to be lowered whenever the disk is being accessed.  Some
          unusual modem or cable arrangements may not tolerate the RTS line
          being lowered.  In this case, the RTS handshake can be disabled
          with the -HR option.

          If you have frequent CRC errors or COM Overrun errors, which
          persist in spite of the handshake-slow option (-HS), you should
          consider upgrading your serial port from the usual 8250 to a
          newer, buffered NS16550AN chip.  The buffered chips are highly
          recommended if you are operating at high baud rates (>9600) or
          are accessing extended memory or are multi-tasking.

          I have also had reports that use of large numbers of dos BUFFERS
          in CONFIG.SYS can cause overrun errors.  Try reducing the BUFFERS
          setting to 10 or less, especially if you also use a DISK cache.

          Some disk cache programs have also been reported to cause overrun
          errors.  Try turning the cache OFF before calling HSLINK, and
          turning it back ON again after the transfer is completed.

          Some older CGA type display adapters and/or BIOS combinations may
          cause data loss during retrace delays (snow filtering).  If you
          experience unexplained COM Overrun errors you may solve the
          problem by adding either -NV (no direct video writes) or -NF
          (disable full screen display) to the command line.

          The National NS16550AN is a pin compatible plug in replacement
          for 8250 and 16450 serial chips.  It contains hardware buffering
          to allow faster operation in systems with high interrupt service
          latency.

                           Full Streaming Data Transmission
          _________________________________________________________________

          The HS/Link protocol allows multiple data blocks to be
          transmitted before an acknowledgement is required by use of block
          numbers combined with a window algorithm.

          The protocol also allows acknowledgements to be combined with
          data flowing in the opposite direction, making it possible to
          achieve full streaming simultaneously in both directions over a
          full duplex communication link.

          Even though the transmitters operate in full streaming mode, the
          receivers normally will periodically acknowledge that data is
          being received.  This acknowledgement can be disabled with the -A
          option.

          Recent advances in high speed modem technology have made it
          possible to simultaneously
          transfer data at high speeds in   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
          both directions.  This            ³The HST modem is not well  ³

          in many new modems.  The          ³modes, if available, for   ³

          these modems, cutting online
          time as much as 50% when equal amounts of data are transmitted
          and received.

          Some older high speed modems, such as the HST and Hayes-V, do not
          implement V.32 and are able to transfer quickly in only one
          direction, while the other direction is relatively slow.  HS/Link
          will still perform well as a single direction protocol with these
          modems, but bidirectional
          thruput will be low due to the    ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿

                            Full Streaming Error Recovery
          _________________________________________________________________

          The HS/Link protocol has the unique ability to recover from many
          transmission errors without breaking out of full streaming mode.

          This is important with buffered modems or packet switched
          networks with long turnaround times.

          Conventional protocols, such as Zmodem, simply reposition the
          transmitter after an error, requiring a retransmission of not
          only the erroneous data, but also the entire stream of data that
          was in transit at the time the error was detected.

          The HS protocol can correct bad
          blocks without retransmitting     ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿

                              Dynamic Code Substitution
          _________________________________________________________________

          Certain byte codes cannot be transmitted directly over the COM
          link.  For instance, the codes for Control-X, Control-S and
          Control-Q must be "escaped" to prevent a conflict with flow or
          program control.

          The HS/Link protocol uses a new Dynamic Code Substitution system
          to drastically reduce number protocol overhead and "escape" codes
          needed to transmit certain data streams.

          Highly compressed data files (such as ZIP and GIF files) benefit
          the most, since they often have many byte codes that cannot be
          transmitted directly over the COM link.

          The Dynamic Code Substitution feature can be disabled, if you
          wish, with the -NC option.




                            Transmission of Minimal Blocks
          _________________________________________________________________

          The HS/Link protocol includes a
          Minimal Blocks feature, which     ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
          when activated, causes the        ³Enable Minimal-Blocks with ³
          protocol to strip away repeated   ³the -NM option only if you ³
          information from the protocol     ³are operating with an error³
          frames and transmit only the      ³free link.                 ³
          minimal amount of information     ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
          required for data flow.

          This feature results in a savings of over 50% of the normal
          protocol overhead characters in each block of data, while
          retaining full data integrity.  All data and control blocks are
          fully protected by a 32 bit CRC calculation, even when Minimal
          Blocks is in effect.

          The final block in a file rarely ends on an exact transfer block
          boundary.  The HS/Link protocol automatically shortens the final
          block, eliminating extraneous data transmission at the end of
          file.

                               DSZLOG Statistic Logging
          _________________________________________________________________

          When you define the environment variable DSZLOG, the HSLINK
          program will enable transfer logging to the specified filename. 
          For example, the AUTOEXEC statement:
               SET DSZLOG=C:\LOGS\LOG.OUT
          will cause HSLINK to log files transmitted to C:\LOGS\LOG.OUT. 
          This form of logging provides compatibility with programs that
          are designed to operate with DSZ or other DSZLOG-type protocols.

          The log file consists of a single line of text for each file

                                Network Compatibility
          _________________________________________________________________

          All file processing is fully
          network and "share" compatible.   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
          HSLINK can be easily installed    ³HS/Link automatically   ³
          in multi-user or networked        ³enables file sharing in ³
          computers.  This works with DOS   ³network environments.   ³
          version 3.0 and later.            ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


          When transmitting a file, the file is opened in "allow read, deny
          none" mode.

          When receiving a file, the newly created file is created in
          "allow read, allow write, deny all" mode, which prevents other
          programs from altering the file which is being created.

          If a file sharing violation is detected when opening a file, the
          program passes control to the system's current "critical error"
          handler.  To automate recovery from file sharing violations, you
          should consider installing my FATAL14.ZIP program, which will
          automatically retry after sharing violations, and which will keep
          a detailed log of all critical errors in a system since the time
          the program was loaded into memory.

          All files transmitted or received with HS/Link retain their
          original exact size and time/date stamp.  No extraneous data is
          added beyond EOF as with some older protocols.  The current
          date/time will be stamped on incoming files if the -NT option is
          used.  Otherwise, the original file's time/date stamp will be
          retained.

          When run under DOS 2.x, HSLINK automatically reverts to non-share
          file modes.

                                   Auto Downloading
          _________________________________________________________________

          It is possible for some terminal
          programs to support HS/Link auto  ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
          downloading by means of           ³With HS/Link Auto-Download ³
          "scripts" which wait for the      ³You don't have to hit any  ³
          HS/Link "ready" packet, and then  ³additional keys to execute ³
          shell out to the HSLINK receiver  ³the HSLINK driver.         ³
          protocol.                         ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


          This capability is currently active when HS/Link is installed in
          {COMMO} and BOYAN 5.0, any may be available soon under many other
          terminal programs as the respective authors add the capability to
          recognize external protocol signon signatures.


          The HS/Link "ready" packet is repeated at 10 second intervals
          when waiting for the HSLINK receiver to be started.  The format
          of the "ready" packet is:

               ^B "R"
          or in hex,
               0x02 0x52

          When this sequence of characters is received during a terminal 
          session, the HSLINK protocol should be executed.


          The HSLINK program sends a different "ready" packet when no files
          need to be sent, but upload files are expected from the remote
          system.  This "ready" packet signature can be used to implement
          HS/Link Automatic Upload.  The format of the "upload ready"
          packet is:

               ^B "Q"
          or in hex,
               0x02 0x51

          When this sequence of characters is received during a terminal
          session, an HS/Link upload should be started.

                                    Error Messages
          _________________________________________________________________

          Bad ____ CRC
               These messages indicate that an error was detected in a
               control message between the sender and the receiver.  All
               control packets are protected by a 32 bit CRC calculation to
               provide highly secure and reliable communication.

               If you repeatedly receive the "Bad ready packet CRC"
               message, it may indicate that the internal protocol formats
               have been changed and that you need to upgrade to a newer
               beta copy of HSLINK.

          Bad data CRC (#)
               This message indicates that an error was detected in a block
               of data in the file being received.  Error correction is
               automatic, because of Full-Streaming-Error-Correction, may
               occur without breaking the stream of data being received.

               If this message occurs at regular intervals, it is a sign of
               flow control failure.  In most cases, this can be corrected
               with the addition of the -HS command line option.

          COM#: Break!
          COM#: Framing!
          COM#: Overrun!
          COM#: Parity!
               These messages indicate that an error was detected in the
               serial port receiver.  Framing and Parity errors often
               indicate a baud rate mismatch.  Overrun errors usually
               indicate the need for flow control or for an upgrade to a
               buffered serial chip.  Overrun errors can often be reduced
               or eliminated with the use of the -HS command line option.

          Can't create file '___'
               This indicates that the received file could not be created. 
               This usually indicates that the directory specified in the -
               U command line option is invalid, or that the disk is full.

          Carrier lost!
               This indicates that Carrier detect was dropped, aborting the
               HSLINK session.  If your connection does not provide a
               carrier detect signal, you can disable this check with the -
               C command line option.  This is often required when directly
               connecting two computers by means of a "null modem" cable.

          Control-X abort!
               This indicates that the control-x character was received
               twice in succession, either over the COM port or from the
               local keyboard.

          Disk write failure!  (#)
               This usually indicates that the disk is full and that
               further downloads cannot be received.

          Flow control released (#### t:# r:#)
               If output flow has been suspended by either software or
               hardware flow control for more than 15 seconds, the program
               will assume that there has been a failure of flow control
               and will release the hold so data can continue.  The codes
               in parenthesis indicate which flow controls were active at
               the time (C=CTS was down, T=transmitter XOFF was pending,
               R=receiver XOFF was pending, A=transmitter is currently
               active) and the counts of bytes in the transmit and receive
               holding queues.

          FILE was incomplete!  (# #)
               This message indicates that the transfer was aborted in some
               way before the specified file was completely received. 
               Normally incomplete files are erased from disk, but they
               will be retained of the -K command line option is used.

          Not allowed to overwrite existing file '___'
               This indicates that a file was received but there was
               another file with the same name already in the download file
               directory.  Either erase the duplicate file, or use the -O
               option to allow existing files to be overwritten.

          Insufficient memory to load program.
          Not enough memory!
               There was not enough memory available to run HSLINK.  Free
               additional memory by removing "TSR" software, device
               drivers, ramdisks or disk caches.  If your COMM program has
               the option of swapping to DISK or EMS, enable the option to
               free additional memory for HSLINK's use.  Current beta
               copies of HSLINK require about 64k of RAM, but the specific
               amount of memory required is subject to change from beta to
               beta.  You can reduce the amount of memory required if you
               use the -HB command line option to disable file buffering.

          Read failure at #
               This indicates that there was a disk error reading a file
               being transmitted.

          Remote not responding!
               This indicates that the remote computer did not execute
               HSLINK and establish a connection within the two minute
               timeout period.

          Receive timeout (#)
          ACK timeout, resend #
               This message indicates that it has been too long since the
               receiver responded to data transmission.  The last data
               block is repeated in an attempt to wake up the receiver.

          Advance from block # to #
               After successful error recovery, the receiver may request
               the transmitter skip over blocks that have been previously
               received without error.

          Block size: #
               This message indicates the actual block size being used for
               file transfers.  The block size is controlled by the -W
               parameter, and may be overridden by the remote computer if
               the remote uses the -!  (take priority) option.

          COM#: # bps
               This message indicates the actual COM port speed in use,
               either as specified with the -B command line option, or as
               determined from the current hardware settings.

          HS/Link finished! (t:# r:#) Exit code = #
               When HSLINK terminates, it sets the dos ERRORLEVEL to the
               specified value.  This can be checked in batch files to
               detect error conditions.  Under normal conditions, HSLINK
               exits with an ERRORLEVEL of 0.  If, however, the session
               terminated due to errors, or was aborted by the operator,
               the ERRORLEVEL will be non-0.  The following ERRORLEVEL
               codes are possible:

          File received OK, # cps, # seconds.
               The file was received correctly and is now closed.  The
               average transfer speed is calculated based on the elapsed
               time between receiving the file open packet and the last
               byte of the file.  Transfer speeds are calculated using the
               DOS timer tick, which is not accurate for transfers taking
               less than 1 second to complete.  For very short transfers, a
               cps rating of 9999 will be returned.

          File sent OK, # cps, # seconds.
               The file was transmitted correctly and is now closed.  The
               average transfer speed is calculated based on the elapsed
               time between sending the first byte of the file and the last
               byte of the file.  Transfer speeds are calculated using the
               DOS timer tick, which is not accurate for transfers taking
               less than 1 second to complete.  For very short transfers, a
               cps rating of 9999 will be returned.

          File skipped!
               The transmitter prints this message when the receiver
               requests the current file be skipped.  This usually happens
               when the receiver detects a duplicate filename and is not
               allowed to overwrite existing files.

          Handshake: CTS XON/XOFF SLOW
               This message indicates the current combination of flow
               control options that are in effect.  CTS indicates CTS
               hardware flow control is active.  XON/XOFF indicates that
               XON/XOFF software flow control is active.  SLOW indicates
               that flow will be restrained during disk I/O to prevent
               overrun errors.

          Out of sequence # (#)
               This indicates that the received block was out of sequence,
               indicating that a block was possibly missed or lost during
               transmission.  The receiver will request the transmitter to
               retransmit the missing block(s).

          Received block # (# bytes) # cps
               This displays the current status of the file being received. 
               The current number of blocks and bytes received is displayed
               after each block is received.  The estimated transfer speed
               in ch/sec is also displayed.

          Received block # (# bytes) E#
               When "E#" is displayed following the received block #
               message, it indicates that error recovery is in progress,
               and that the specified block number was in error and is in
               transit from the transmitter.  When the erroneous block has
               been received correctly the E# display will advance to the
               next erroneous block number, or will be erased if no more
               erroneous blocks are pending.

          Received block # (# bytes) R
               When "R" is displayed following the received block #
               message, it indicates that current block has been previously
               received correctly and is therefore a "repeat" block. 
               Repeat blocks occur under severe error conditions and are
               usually corrected automatically.

          Receiving file: ___ (# blocks, # bytes)
               This message indicates that a new file is being received
               from the transmitter.  The file size is displayed in blocks
               and bytes.

          Resending block #
               This message indicates that the receiver has detected an
               erroneous block and is requesting a retransmission to
               correct the data.  Data flow continues where it left off
               prior to the resend, allowing error recovery to take place
               without breaking out of full streaming mode and without
               discarding data that is already in transit to the receiver. 
               This is the basis of Full- Streaming-Error-Correction.

          Restarting current file
               This indicates that the receiver was unable to recover from
               errors encountered in processing the current file being
               transmitted, and has requested that the file be started
               again from scratch.

          Seek from block # to #
               Under the most severe error conditions, the receiver may
               request the transmitter to discard data that is in transit
               to the receiver and to rewind to an earlier position in the
               file and resume transmission.

          Sending block # (# bytes/w:#) # cps
               This is the normal status display while a file is being
               transmitted.  The message indicates the latest block number
               to be transmitted, and in parenthesis indicates the number
               of bytes transmitted and the current number of blocks that
               have been transmitted without acknowledgement, which
               represents the size of the transmit "window" that is
               currently in use.  If this value hangs at the current -W
               setting, you may benefit from a higher -W setting on the
               command line.  The estimated transfer speed is also reported
               in ch/sec.

          Sending file: ___ (# blocks, # bytes)
               This message indicates that a new file is being transmitted
               to the receiver.  The file size is displayed in blocks and
               bytes.

          Transfer aborted!
               This message indicates that the current file transfer has
               been aborted for some reason.  The specific reason for the
               transfer abort is usually also printed on the screen.

          Waiting for remote.
               This message indicates that HSLINK is waiting to handshake
               with the remote computer.  HSLINK will wait for 60 seconds
               for the other computer to come online; after that the
               transfer is aborted.

          Warning: CTS signal missing!  -HC will be assumed.
               The CTS hardware handshake is normally enabled by default. 
               If, on initial loading, HSLINK finds that the CTS signal is
               down, it assumes that the current hardware configuration is
               not using CTS handshake and automatically disables further
               CTS handshake checks.  Use the -HC command line to manually
               disable CTS handshake.

          Window: #
               This indicates the actual number of blocks that are allowed
               to be in transit without acknowledgement.  This is
               controlled by the -W parameter, and may be overridden by the
               remote computer if the remote uses the -!  (take priority)
               option.

          Window: NONE
               This indicates that the -A command line option has been
               specified, and that the transmitter is required to continue
               indefinitely without receiving any kind of acknowledgement
               from the receiver that data is being received correctly.

                               License and Registration
          _________________________________________________________________

          This program is not free!  You are hereby licensed to use this
          program for a trial period of 30 days free of charge.  If, after
          30 days, you decide that you would like to continue using HSLINK,
          you must complete the registration form (REGISTER.FRM) and return
          it to the author with the required registration fee enclosed.

          Registration removes the "UNREGISTERED" message and also enables
          a bar-graphic display of file transfer status, an estimation of
          remaining time to transfer each file, and a calculation of
          combined thruput during bidirectional transfers.

          Introductory HSLINK registration costs $15 US, which includes a
          registration certificate showing a Serial Number and Password. 
          Registration fees increase to $20 on 2/1/92, so please register
          early.  For $25 US, a disk containing the latest release of
          HSLINK, along with a registration certificate can be obtained. 
          Printed and bound operation manuals are also available for $15
          each.  Each registration is valid for use on a single CPU or on a
          single BBS system (multi-node systems require only a single
          registration).

          Please feel free to distribute unregistered HSLINK to your
          friends and local BBSes as long as all of the files in this
          archive are included and unmodified.

          Shareware distributors may distribute this program as long as the
          author has been notified, in writing, prior to ANY distribution. 
          The "per disk" charge may not exceed $6 and the shareware
          distributor will not change the above license fee for the end
          user of HSLINK.  End users are not exempt from registering HSLINK
          with the author at the normal registration fee.
