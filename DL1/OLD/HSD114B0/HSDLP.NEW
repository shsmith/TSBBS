DLP HS/Link Revision History (in reverse order)
-----------------------------------------------

18-May-93
   Multiple outgoing files are now properly supported.

   Added a check for overflowing COMM buffers and a warning message
   when the buffer needs to be set larger.

   Rewrote displays to eliminate use of Borland Custom Controls as
   problems resulted from missing or incorrect BWCC.DLL files.
