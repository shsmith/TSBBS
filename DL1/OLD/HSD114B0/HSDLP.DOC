            A version of the HS/Link File Transfer Protocol
                              for use with
                        ProComm Plus for Windows

                    (PRELIMINARY APPLICATION NOTES)


HSLINK.DLP is a special version of the HS/Link program which has been
written specifically for use by ProComm Plus for Windows (PROWIN).


                              INSTALLATION

If you are upgrading from a previous version of HSLINK.DLP, you should
first remove HSLINK.DLP from your PROWIN directory and then load PROWIN.
This removes internal information from PROWIN's PW.PRM file to prepare
for installation of the new version of HSLINK.DLP.

Simply place the file HSLINK.DLP in your PROWIN directory, and the
HSLINK protocol will automatically appear in the protocol menus and will
work as other protocols do in this environment.

If you wish to set additional HS/Link options, you can create an
HSLINK.CFG file in your PROWIN directory.

If you wish to include HS/Link in your "host mode" operations, copy the
supplied HOST.WAS file to your PROWIN\ASPECT directory.



                               OPERATION

Once HSLINK.DLP is installed in your PROWIN directory, the HS/Link
protocol will automatically appear in PROWIN's protocol menus.
Downloads are automatic and require no special attention.



                              DIFFERENCES

HSLINK.DLP is similar to the standard HSLINK with the following
exceptions:

*  GIF files are automatically displayed onscreen during file transfer.

*  The command line is automatically provided by PROWIN.  Use the
   HSCONFIG utility or edit the HSLINK.CFG file to provide command
   options.

*  The -P, -PB, -PI, -B, -FT, -HC, -HR options are ignored since PROWIN
   now controls all COM port details.

*  The -NF -NV -CB -CM -CT -CW -CP options are ignored since PROWIN and
   the Windows Control Panel now control display and colors.



                                  NOTE

This is a pre-release test version of this program.  Some of the
following features are not yet fully implemented:

*  The XON/XOFF handshake has not been tested and may not work,
   depending on how PROWIN's built-in drivers handle XON/XOFF handshake.
   I recommend you use the -HX -! options in your HSLINK.CFG file until
   this is resolved in a later test version.

*  This version runs only in "unregistered" mode and cannot be branded.

*  Because this is an early beta version, please keep track of any
   problems you have, including HSERR log listings, and report them to
   the author so corrections can be made.  THANKS!


              !!!!!!!!!!!!!! BETA TEST VERSION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
     This version may seem to work, but it has not been fully tested and
              is not an official release!  You have been warned.
           PLEASE MAKE FREQUENT BACKUP COPIES OF ALL CRITICAL FILES
              !!!!!!!!!!!!!! BETA TEST VERSION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    Beta Testing is a means of getting widespread exposure to unfinished
    versions of a program during the development process.  The idea is for
    as many users as possible to "beta test" the program and to make
    suggestions and report bugs.  This type of widespread testing can lead
    to a very stable and bug-free finished product (the RELEASE version).
    Please read HSLINK.NEW to see what has been changed recently.  If you
    encounter problems or would like to make a suggestion, please read the
    SUPPORT section of HSLINK.DOC for instructions on how to reach the
    author.

    HS/Link product support is available by voice at (818) 891-4228
    between 9am and 6pm pacific time, TUESDAY through SATURDAY.

    To obtain newer beta test versions, please call (818) 891-1344
    and select the "free downloading" service from the initial "special
    services menu".  You need not be a registered Tool Shop BBS user to
    access this special service.
