The file FHSLINK.EXE is the new FOSSIL version of the HS/Link protocol
driver.  This version of HS/Link is useful if you are using FOSSIL
drivers to access your COM ports.  You may need FOSSIL drivers with non-
standard computer equipment or with many multi-port serial cards, such
as the Digi-board.

FOSSIL HS/Link is identical to the standard HSLINK with the following
exceptions:

*  It appears that some FOSSIL implementations (including X00) accept
   both 0x11/0x13 _and_ 0x91/0x93 as the "XON/XOFF" codes, causing data
   loss when the handshake is enabled.  Because of this, the XON/XOFF
   handshake may not work with some FOSSIL drivers.  To disable this
   handshake, include -HX -! in the command line.  The Opus!Comm fossil
   (OCOM531.ZIP) appears to correctly handle this handshake, but some
   versions of X00 do not.

*  You MUST specify the COM port opening speed with the -B option.  I
   was not able to reliably determine the current COM port speed using
   X00.  Future versions may remove this requirement.

*  The RTS handshake functions are not available in standard version 5
   FOSSIL drivers, so the -HS option may not work.  Support has been
   added for X00 drivers, which extend the standard to allow this type
   of handshake.

*  I recommend a FOSSIL transmit buffer size of at least 5k.  The
   receive buffer size is not as important, but should be increased if
   FHSLINK reports receiver overflow errors.  Consult your FOSSIL driver
   documentation for details of setting buffer sizes.

*  The -PB, -PI, -N5 and -FT options are ignored since the FOSSIL driver
   now controls all low-level COM port details.
