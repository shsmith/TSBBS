 SHORT VERSION

 DOS HS/Link Bi-directional Protocol.  HS/Link is a high speed, single and
 bi-directional file transfer protocol with many advanced features.  It is
 EASY to set up and runs very fast with all kinds of modems.  Now includes
 ONLINE CHAT mode. FHSLINK.EXE now supports FOSSIL drivers.


 EXTENDED VERSION

 HS/Link is a file transfer protocol driver capable of simultaneous "CHAT",
 transmission of computer files, and reception of files, at high speeds.
 HS/Link has built-in error correction and is easily installed in most
 telecommunication programs and bulletin board systems.  Bidirectional file
 transfer means that uploading and downloading of files can take place
 simultaneously, thus reducing file transfer time up to 50% on many long
 distance phone calls.

 The HS/Link protocol is now used on thousands of bulletin board systems
 worldwide, and is frequently used to transport large volumes of message
 traffic in echo networks.

 Includes FHSLINK.EXE for FOSSIL driver support.
 See HS-INST##.ZIP for install instructions.

                  COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION LICENSE AGREEMENT
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The terms below outline requirements for commercial distribution.  By
 "commercial distribution" or "commerically distribute" we mean to distribute
 for gain (such as, but not limited to, via traditional shareware catalogs,
 trade shows, or rack vending).  This file will inform the potential
 commercial distributor as to whether or not they have been automatically
 granted such a license for their type of distribution (if not, special
 written authorization is required).  Other important information is also
 presented.

 This is an agreement between you (either an individual or an entity) and THE
 TOOL SHOP.  By commercially distributing copies of the shareware evaluation
 version of HIGH SPEED LINK, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this
 agreement.  If you do not agree to the terms of this agreement, you may not
 distribute the shareware evaluation version of HIGH SPEED LINK.

 1) COPYRIGHT: The shareware evaluation version of HIGH SPEED LINK (hereafter,
 "the SOFTWARE") is Copyright 1991-1994 by Samuel H. Smith and is protected by
 United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  THE TOOL
 SHOP, as exclusive publisher, is an authorized representative of the
 copyright holder.  Except to the extent expressly licensed, the copyright
 holder has and reserves the exclusive copyright and other right, title, and
 interest to copy and distribute this software, and the right to use the
 Trademarks "HS/Link" and "HIGH SPEED LINK" in connection with it.

 2) DISTRIBUTION VIA CATALOGS: Catalog vendors are automatically granted a
 license to distribute the SOFTWARE via their catalog for a fee provided they
 agree to abide by the following terms:

   a) A copy of the first catalog or listing advertising the distribution of
      the SOFTWARE will be sent to THE TOOL SHOP.

   b) The catalog or listing must contain a statement to the effect that the
      SOFTWARE is not free, and that additional payment to the
      author/publisher is required after a stated evaluation period. (The
      standard statement required by the Association of Shareware
      Professionals is sufficient.)

   c) Updated versions of the SOFTWARE sent to the distributor will be
      reflected in what is distributed and advertised in the catalog or
      listing as soon as possible.

   d) Problems or complaints about the SOFTWARE will be reported to THE TOOL
      SHOP.

 3) DISTRIBUTION VIA CD-ROM: CD-ROM vendors are automatically granted a
 license to distribute the SOFTWARE via their CD-ROM for a fee provided they
 agree to abide by the following terms:

   a) The CD-ROM must contain a statement to the effect that the SOFTWARE is
      not free, and that additional payment to the author/publisher is
      required after a stated evaluation period. (The standard statement
      required by the Association of Shareware Professionals is sufficient.)

   b) Updated versions of the SOFTWARE sent to the distributor will be
      reflected in what is distributed and advertised in the CD-ROM or listing
      as soon as possible.

   c) Problems or complaints about the SOFTWARE will be reported to THE TOOL
      SHOP.

 4) ALL OTHER TYPES OF DISTRIBUTION: Distribution of the SOFTWARE using any
 other method (for example: via rack vending methods, sale in a retail store,
 sale at a trade show, as part of some more inclusive product or service,
 rental or lease) requires special written authorization from THE TOOL SHOP,
 which may be subject to special licensing terms.  No vendor, individual,
 group, or entity has a license to distribute the SOFTWARE using any other
 method without special written authorization from THE TOOL SHOP.  (NOTE: "as
 part of some more inclusive product or service" does not refer to
 distribution via any type of BBS or the practice by certain catalog vendors
 of offering several programs on a single diskette or in a set of multiple
 diskettes.)

 5) MODIFICATIONS: The SOFTWARE package may not be abridged or otherwise
 modified in any way.  (NOTE: This does not refer to the addition of
 installation, informational, or advertising files.)

 6) REVOCATION OF LICENSE: The license to distribute the SOFTWARE can be
 revoked from any vendor, individual, group, or entity at any time for any
 reason on 90 days advance written notice.

 7) DAMAGES: Distribution of the SOFTWARE without a license to do so is
 explicitly prohibited.  Liquidated damages for unauthorized distribution
 shall not be less than $2.00 (in U.S. funds) for each individual copy of the
 SOFTWARE that is sold or transferred by the vendor, individual, group, or
 entity without a license to do so.

 8) THIS PACKAGE (CONSISTING OF THE HIGH SPEED LINK SOFTWARE AND ASSOCIATED
 FILES AND DOCUMENTATION) IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR
 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT

 CURRENTNESS.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE USE OF THIS PACKAGE IS ASSUMED BY THE
 USER.  IN NO EVENT WILL THE TOOL SHOP BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, DIRECT,
 INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL, RESULTING FROM ANY DEFECT IN THE
 PACKAGE, EVEN IF THE TOOL SHOP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.  ANY AND ALL USE OF THIS PACKAGE, FOR ANY PURPOSE, WITH NO REGARD TO
 THE LEGALITY OF SUCH USE OR PURPOSE, IS THE COMPLETE AND SOLE RESPONSIBILITY
 OF THE USER. Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
 the exclusion of consequential damages, so the above disclaimers and
 exclusions may not apply to you.

 9) GOVERNING LAW: This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of
 California.  Should any parts or parts of this agreement be deemed unlawful,
 the remainder shall to continue to apply.
