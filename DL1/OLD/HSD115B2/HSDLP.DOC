            A version of the HS/Link File Transfer Protocol
                              for use with
                  ProComm Plus for Windows Version 2.x



HSLINK.DLP is a special version of the HS/Link program which has been
written specifically for use by ProComm Plus for Windows Version 2.x
(PROWIN2).


                              INSTALLATION

Simply place the HSLINK.DLP in your PROWIN2 directory, and the HSLINK
protocol will automatically appear in the protocol menus and will work
as other protocols do in this environment.

If you wish to include HS/Link in your "host mode" operations, copy the
supplied _HOST.WAS file to your PROWIN2\ASPECT\HOST directory.



                               OPERATION

Once HSLINK.DLP is installed in your PROWIN2 directory, the HS/Link
protocol will automatically appear in PROWIN2's protocol menus.

Downloads are automatic and require no special attention.

To upload, click the "upload" icon and select files to transmit.

                           *** IMPORTANT ***
          To perform a bidirectional transfer, note that you
          MUST NOT press the final <ENTER> key required by the
          BBS you are calling.  Instead, click the "upload" icon
          and flag outgoing files.  When HSLINK starts on your
          end, it will send the final <ENTER> key sequence to
          the BBS.


                             CONFIGURATION

If you wish to set HS/Link options, you can modify the HSLINK.INI file
in your PROWIN2 directory.  These settings are normally manipulated via
the "Advanced!" setup option of HS/Link from within PROWIN2.

To configure HSLINK.DLP, activate ProComm+ "Current Setup" ICON, push
the Transfer Protocol button, then select HSLINK as the "Current
Protocol".

Crash Recovery settings
        Off
                Disable crash recovery.  Do not allow received files to
                overwrite existing files.  Partial files from aborted
                transfers are automatically erased.

        Full Recovery
                Enable full crash recovery.  This option causes partial
                files from aborted transfers to be retained.  If a
                received file matches the filename of an existing file,
                the contents of the file is compared to the received
                file, and only those blocks which differ are
                transferred.

        Overwrite
                Disable crash recovery.  Allow received files to
                overwrite existing files.  Partial files from aborted
                transfers are retained.


Block Size settings
        256     Each block will be 265 bytes in length
        1k      Each block will be 1024 bytes in length
        2k      Each block will be 2048 bytes in length
        4k      Each block will be 4096 bytes in length

Acknowledge Window Settings
        Full streaming (none)
                In this mode of operation, blocks are transmitted
                continuously with no acknowledgement of receipt.  This
                mode of operation is useful when error correcting modems
                are used or when flow control is not required.

        8 blocks (normal)
                In this mode of operation, up to 8 blocks may be in
                transit before an acknowledgement of receipt is
                required.  Once acknowledgement is received, the next
                block will be transmitted.  This acknowledgement process
                provides a form of flow control which is useful when
                other forms of flow control are not totally reliable.

        4 blocks (PC Pursuit)
                When running HSLINK on a PC Pursuit connection, I
                recommend the settings of Ack Window = 4, Block size =
                256, Minimal Blocks = OFF.

File Settings
        Transfer Log File:
                This defines the DSZLOG-style transfer result log
                filename.  If left blank, the DSZLOG environment
                variable specifies this filename.  If no DSZLOG
                environment setting exists, no logfile will be produced.

        Error Log File:
                This defines the filename for a detailed transfer and
                error log to be created.  If left blank, the HSERR
                environment variable specifies this filename.  If no
                HSERR environment setting exists, no logfile will be
                produced.

        Duplicate Checklist:
                This defines the filename of a duplication checklist
                file.  The duplication checklist file can contain a list
                of directories or filenames to check for duplication. If
                an incoming file matches a filename or a file in a
                directory listed here, the file will be rejected.
                NOTE: duplication checking is active ONLY when Crash
                Recovery is set to "OFF".  Other crash recovery modes
                grant HSLINK permission to modify existing files, making
                a duplication checklist meaningless.

Other Options
        Original Time Stamp
                Checking this option causes the original file's time and
                date to be preserved.  Unchecking the option causes the
                current time and date to be given to a file when it is
                received.

        Minimal Blocks
                Checking this option causes HSLINK to minimize each
                block transmitted, resulting in an increase in thruput.
                Unchecking this option causes HSLINK to include
                additional information in each block as required by PC
                Pursuit or some other environments.

        File Buffering
                Checking this option causes HSLINK to use a 10k buffer
                for files being received or transmitted.  Unchecking
                this option causes HSLINK to read or write each file
                block as it is sent or received.

        Allow Bidirectional Transfers
                Checking this option allows files to be received while
                files are being transmitted.  Unchecking this option
                causes HSLINK to reject any incoming files when files
                are being transmitted.

        Beeper in Chat Mode
                Checking this option allows the remote unit to beep your
                speaker with the "page remote" or ^G key in CHAT mode.
                Unchecking this option forces your speaker to remain
                silent at all times.

        Force Remote to use Local Settings
                Checking this option causes forces the remote unit to
                use your settings for Minimal Blocks, Block Size, Ack
                Window and Xon/Xoff.  Unchecking this option allows the
                remote unit to override your settings, or causes
                compromise settings to be negotiated according to both
                local and remote options.


Controls
        OK
                This causes current settings to be saved.

        Cancel
                This causes changes in settings to be discarded and
                previous settings to remian in effect.

                              DIFFERENCES

HSLINK.DLP is similar to the standard DOS HSLINK with the following
exceptions:

*  GIF files are automatically displayed onscreen during file transfer.

*  The command line is automatically provided by PROWIN2.  Use the
   integrated setup screens, or modify the HSLINK.INI file to provide
   protocol options.

*  The "REGISTER" screen now accepts DLP HS/Link activation codes.
   Sorry, but DOS HS/Link registrations are not valid for the Windows
   DLP version.
