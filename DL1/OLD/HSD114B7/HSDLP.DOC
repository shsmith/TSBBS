            A version of the HS/Link File Transfer Protocol
                              for use with
                        ProComm Plus for Windows

                    (PRELIMINARY APPLICATION NOTES)


HSLINK.DLP is a special version of the HS/Link program which has been written
specifically for use by ProComm Plus for Windows (PROWIN).


                              INSTALLATION

Simply place the HSLINK.DLP in your PROWIN directory, and the HSLINK protocol
will automatically appear in the protocol menus and will work as other
protocols do in this environment.

If you wish to include HS/Link in your "host mode" operations, copy the
supplied HOST.WAS file to your PROWIN\ASPECT directory.


                               OPERATION

Once HSLINK.DLP is installed in your PROWIN directory, the HS/Link protocol
will automatically appear in PROWIN's protocol menus.

Downloads are automatic and require no special attention.

To upload, click the "upload" icon and select files to transmit.

To perform a bidirectional transfer, note that you MUST NOT press the final
<ENTER> key required by the BBS you are calling.  Instead, click the "upload"
icon and flag outgoing files.  When HSLINK starts on your end, it will send
the final <ENTER> key sequence to the BBS.

                             CONFIGURATION

If you wish to set HS/Link options, you can modify the HSLINK.INI file in
your PROWIN directory.  These settings are normally manipulated via the
"Advanced!" setup option of HS/Link from within PROWIN.

To configure HSLINK.DLP, activate ProComm+ "Current Setup" ICON, then
highlight the button "Protocol: hslink.dlp" and click "Advanced!".

Crash Recovery settings
        Off
                Disable crash recovery.  Do not allow received files to
                overwrite existing files.  Partial files from aborted
                transfers are automatically erased.

        Full Recovery
                Enable full crash recovery.  This option causes partial
                files from aborted transfers to be retained.  If a
                received file matches the filename of an existing file,
                the contents of the file is compared to the received
                file, and only those blocks which differ are
                transferred.

        Overwrite
                Disable crash recovery.  Allow received files to
                overwrite existing files.  Partial files from aborted
                transfers are retained.


Block Size settings
        256     Each block will be 265 bytes in length
        1k      Each block will be 1024 bytes in length
        2k      Each block will be 2048 bytes in length
        4k      Each block will be 4096 bytes in length

Acknowledge Window Settings
        Full streaming (none)
                In this mode of operation, blocks are transmitted
                continuously with no acknowledgement of receipt.  This
                mode of operation is useful when error correcting modems
                are used or when flow control is not required.

        8 blocks (normal)
                In this mode of operation, up to 8 blocks may be in
                transit before an acknowledgement of receipt is
                required.  Once acknowledgement is received, the next
                block will be transmitted.  This acknowledgement process
                provides a form of flow control which is useful when
                other forms of flow control are not totally reliable.

        4 blocks (PC Pursuit)
                When operating HSLINK on a PC Pursuit connection, I
                recommend the settings of Ack Window = 4, Block size =
                256, Xon/Xoff = ON, Minimal Blocks = OFF.

File Settings
        Transfer Log File:
                This defines the DSZLOG-style transfer result log
                filename.  If left blank, the DSZLOG environment
                variable specifies this filename.  If no DSZLOG
                environment setting exists, no logfile will be produced.

        Error Log File:
                This defines the filename for a detailed transfer and
                error log to be created.  If left blank, the HSERR
                environment variable specifies this filename.  If no
                HSERR environment setting exists, no logfile will be
                produced.

        Duplicate Checklist:
                This defines the filename of a duplication checklist
                file.  The duplication checklist file can contain a list
                of directories or filenames to check for duplication.
                If an incoming file matches a filename or a file in a
                directory listed here, the file will be rejected.
                NOTE: duplication checking is active ONLY when Crash
                Recovery is set to "OFF".  Other crash recovery modes
                grant HSLINK permission to modify existing files, making
                a duplication checklist meaningless.

Other Options
        Original File Time Stamp
                Checking this option causes the original file's time and
                date to be preserved.  Unchecking the option causes the
                current time and date to be given to a file when it is
                received.

        Minimal Blocks
                Checking this option causes HSLINK to minimize each
                block transmitted, resulting in an increase in thruput.
                Unchecking this option causes HSLINK to include
                additional information in each block as required by PC
                Pursuit or some other environments.

        File Buffering
                Checking this option causes HSLINK to use a 10k buffer
                for files being received or transmitted.  Unchecking
                this option causes HSLINK to read or write each file
                block as it is sent or received.

        Large Status Display
                Checking this option causes a larger file transfer
                status display to be used.

        XON/XOFF Handshake
                Checking this option indicates that you desire to use
                the XON/XOFF software handshake.  Unchecking this option
                indicates that you do not desire this handshake, but
                that you will still use it if the remote unit desires
                its use.

        Force Remote to use Local Settings
                Checking this option causes forces the remote unit to
                use your settings for Minimal Blocks, Block Size, Ack
                Window and Xon/Xoff.  Unchecking this option allows the
                remote unit to override your settings, or causes
                compromise settings to be negotiated according to both
                local and remote options.

        Allow Bidirectional Transfers
                Checking this option allows files to be received while
                files are being transmitted.  Unchecking this option
                causes HSLINK to reject any incoming files when files
                are being transmitted.

        Beeper in Chat Mode
                Checking this option allows the remote unit to beep your
                speaker with the "page remote" or ^G key in CHAT mode.
                Unchecking this option forces your speaker to remain
                silent at all times.


Controls
        OK
                This causes current settings to be saved.

        Cancel
                This causes changes in settings to be discarded and
                previous settings to remian in effect.

        Use Default
                This resets all settings to their original default
                values, which should work properly in most
                circumstances.

        Register...
                This allows you to enter your personal registration code
                as well as your name and company name.



                              DIFFERENCES

HSLINK.DLP is similar to the standard DOS HSLINK with the following
exceptions:

*  GIF files are automatically displayed onscreen during file transfer.

*  The command line is automatically provided by PROWIN.  Modify the
   HSLINK.INI file provide protocol options.

*  The "REGISTER" screen now accepts DLP HS/Link activation codes.
   Sorry, but DOS HS/Link registrations are not valid for the Windows
   DLP version.



              !!!!!!!!!!!!!! BETA TEST VERSION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
     This version may seem to work, but it has not been fully tested and
              is not an official release!  You have been warned.
           PLEASE MAKE FREQUENT BACKUP COPIES OF ALL CRITICAL FILES
              !!!!!!!!!!!!!! BETA TEST VERSION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    Beta Testing is a means of getting widespread exposure to unfinished
    versions of a program during the development process.  The idea is for as
    many users as possible to "beta test" the program and to make suggestions
    and report bugs.  This type of widespread testing can lead to a very
    stable and bug-free finished product (the RELEASE version). Please read
    HSLINK.NEW to see what has been changed recently.

    If you encounter problems or would like to make a suggestion, please
    contact the author. HS/Link product support is available by voice at
    (818) 891-4228 between 9am and 6pm pacific time, TUESDAY through
    SATURDAY.

    To obtain newer beta test versions, please call (818) 891-1344 and select
    the "free downloading" service from the initial "special services menu".
    You need not be a registered Tool Shop BBS user to access this special
    service.
