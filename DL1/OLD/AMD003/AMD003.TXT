       1.4  "Technical Information" shall mean any confidential or
       proprietary trade secret information, know-how, data, methods,
       processes, specifications, quality standards, sales literature,
       reports, or training materials in any way related to or connected
       with the Computer Software.

       1.5  "Territory" shall mean the Territory defined in attached
       Exhibit "B."


       Section 2.  Grant of Rights

       2.1  Subject to the terms and conditions set fourth herein,
       Developer grants Agent a non-exclusive right to market Computer
       Software and Third Party Software throughout the Territory.

       2.2  Agent agrees to commit itself to a thorough, vigorous, and
       diligent program of exploiting and selling Computer Software and
       Third Party Software throughout the Territory, in accordance with
       the customs and practices of the computer software industry, so
       that full utilization of the Computer Software will result and
       sales of the Computer Software will achieve a reasonably high
       level within the Territory.

       2.3  Developer shall have the right to thoroughly review the
       performance of Agent not less frequently than every six (6)
       months to determine whether Agent is in compliance with the
       performance criteria set fourth in paragraph 2.2.  In the event
       Developer, in its sole and exclusive judgement, determines that
       said performance criteria are not being met, Developer shall have
       the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the provisions
       of paragraph 8.2.

       2.4  Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Developer from

       Software and Third Party Software.

       2.5  Developer will refer all sales requests received from
       customers in Agent's territory to Agent for handling.  However,
       in the event a customer in Agent's territory wishes to deal
       directly with Developer for their purchase and/or support,
       Developer reserves the right to service such requests as it sees
       fit in order to prevent a lost sales opportunity.



       Section 3.  Price, Payment, and Recording

       3.1  Agent agrees that all Computer Software sold by it will be
       sold at a reasonable price, but in no event for a price less than
       that set forth in Developer's current price list, excluding
       shipping and handling.  A current Developer price list is
       attached hereto as Exhibit "A," and will by updated at such time
       as it is modified by Developer.

       3.2  Agent must purchase all Computer Software or Third Party
       Applications according to Developer's current price list.

       In addition to Computer Software costs, Agent must pay to
       Developer all freight, shipping, and handling charges associated
       with providing software.


       3.3  All purchases are on a NET 30 day payment schedule which
       begins the day of shipment from Developer.  Agent must pay for
       all Computer Software with a credit card or an international
       money order payable in U.S. Dollars.

       3.4  All monies payable hereunder shall be paid in United States
       Dollars directly to Developer.  In the event payment in United
       States Dollars is not at that time permitted by law or by reason
       of the decision of any competent authority in the country
       involved, Agent shall then discharge its obligation for payment
       in such other currency and at such place as may be permitted and
       agreed to by Developer. In the event any currency conversion is
       required, such conversion shall be the sole responsibility of
       Agent and shall be made by using the exchange rate prevailing at
       a first class foreign exchange bank in the United States on the
       last business day of the month to which payments relate.

       3.5  Agent shall keep and maintain proper books of account with
       reference to all Computer Software and Third Party Software sold.
       When requested by Developer, such books of account shall be open
       at reasonable times and at reasonable intervals for Developer,
       through a Certified Public Accountant or its equivalent, to
       inspect such books of account and to make abstracts therefrom for
       the purpose of verifying compliance with the provisions of this
       Agreement.  Inspection of the books shall be done during normal
       business hours and in such a manner as to avoid disruption of the
       business of Agent.

       3.6  Agent must submit on a frequent basis the customer data to
       whom computer software was sold.  It is suggested that this will
       be done by each tenth sale of the computer software.  Agent must
       send the customer data by modern telecommunication service i.e.
       FAX machine or by usage of The Toolshop BBS service and not by
       any postal or similar service.



       Section 4.  Duties and Obligations of Developer

       4.1  Developer agrees that Agent shall have the right to return
       any unused or defective inventory, after first providing written
       notice to Developer specifying the precise reason for the return.
       All returns shall be shipped to Developer with freight, shipping,
       and handling charges prepaid by Agent.

       4.2  Developer agrees to provide Agent with a list of Developer's
       existing Computer Software customers within the Territory in
       order to facilitate response to anticipated requests for upgrades
       from such customers.  The customer list shall be updated by
       Developer not less frequently than once each year.


       4.3  Developer agrees to provide Agent with periodic updates
       concerning any changes or improvements in the Computer Software.
       Such updates may take the form of written communications
       forwarded by mail or other suitable means, or may be in the form
       of messages posted on Developer's computer bulletin board system
       and addressed to Agent.


       Section 5.  Duties and Obligation of Agent

       5.1  Agent shall develop and maintain proper and adequate
       security measures to assure that only registered purchasers of
       Software Products, either from Developer or from Agent, have
       access to any registered Developer files.  Agent will also assure
       that customers are not able to obtain access to Software Products
       which they have not purchased.  Shareware products which are
       distributed on a "try before you buy" basis are excluded from
       this.

       5.2  Agent agrees to actively monitor and investigate any and all
       reports of unauthorized use of any Computer Software.  In the
       event Agent suspects that any user is running unauthorized
       software, Agent will immediately take all necessary steps to
       contact the offending party and encourage that party to
       discontinue such activities.  Simultaneously, Agent shall notify
       Developer of such unauthorized activity, and Developer shall have
       the right to take whatever action it deems necessary to protect
       its copyrights, trademarks and other rights in its Computer
       Software and to prevent any further unauthorized use.  Agent
       agrees, without cost to Developer, to fully cooperate with
       Developer in the enforcement and protection of Developer's
       rights.

       5.3  Agent agrees not to make copies of any copyrighted Computer
       Software or Third Party Software.  All software containing media,
       including specifically disks, shall be obtained solely from
       Developer.

       5.4  Agent agrees to provide its purchasers of Software Products
       with adequate user support according to general industry
       practices.  Agent shall maintain a 24 hour per day, 365 day per
       year, Software Product purchaser dedicated bulletin board service
       for customers of both Developer and Agent.  Voice and alternate
       technical support shall be provided at the discretion of Agent.
       For questions and support problems which Agent desires additional
       assistance from Developer, Agent will contact Developer for
       technical assistance through Developer's Customer Support BBS
       system. All responses to support questions made on the Developer
       Customer Support system will be left as a reply to the request.
       Agent will be responsible for obtaining all response messages.


       Section 6.  Developer Trademark and Copyrights

       6.1  In order to facilitate the performance by Agent of its
       duties set forth herein, Developer grants to Agent a nonexclusive
