                    SUMMARY OF WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.1
  ==========================================================================

     HS/Link version 1.1 corrects all known problems in version 1.0 and
     adds a number of new features and options.

     HS/Link version 1.1 is a direct replacement for version 1.0 and
     does not require any change in command line options or
     configuration options.  There are a number of NEW options you may
     want to take a look at.

     The most important new feature in version 1.1 is the "batch status"
     display, which now gives a running summary of total bytes
     transferred and estimated time remaining for the transfer.

     The following options have been added or enhanced:

      -CB     Controls color of bargraph displays.

      -FC     Forces CTS handshake to remain in effect, even when the
              handshake hardware appears to be inactive.

      -FL     Directs log file to specified filename as an alternative
              to using the DSZLOG environment variable.

      -N5     Disable 16550 buffering logic.  Needed when the UART
              appears to be a 16550-type chip, but does not correctly
              implement hardware buffering.

      -NO     Check specified directories or filenames for
              duplication with incoming files.

      -PB     Option now allows non-standard com base addresses to be
              entered in hex as well as decimal.

      -PI     Option now allows high IRQ values 8-15.



  ==========================================================================
                  DETAILED LIST OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1
  ==========================================================================

     Added -CB option to control color of bargraph displays.

     Added -FC option to force CTS handshake to remain in effect, even
     if it CTS is not active initially.  This may be required if you are
     SURE you need CTS handshake, but when CTS is occasionally dropped
     by the modem just as HS/Link loads.

     Added -LFlogfile option to allow DSZLOG log file pathname to be
     specified from a config file when use of the DSZLOG environment
     variable is not desired.

     Added -N5 option to disable the NS16550AN buffering logic, which
     causes problems on some early flawed versions of the 16550 chip.

     Added a new BATCH STATUS display, which shows total bytes expected
     and completed, as well as estimated time remaining for the batch.

     Added a new ERRORLEVEL 10 exit to indicate that carrier was lost
     during the initial handshake with the remote.

     Added a new ERRORLEVEL 11 exit to indicate when the link was
     aborted due to CTS handshake lockup.  This condition can occur with
     some error correcting modems when line conditions are too poor for
     continued data transmission.

     Added a prefix to the original "ready" signature, making it less
     likely that hs/link auto upload or auto download will falsely
     trigger.  The new signatures are:
          HS*^BR
     and
          HS*^BQ
     The 'HS*' prefix has been added.

     Added expected incoming and outgoing file counts in -NF display mode.

     Added logic in HSCONFIG to create the default HSLINK.CFG file in
     the same directory as HSLINK.EXE instead of in the current
     directory.

     Added logic to allow HS/Link operation when DoorWay is active.

     Added logic to allow ^Z eof marking in FILELIST files.

     Added logic to allow hex values to be specified for -PB and most
     other integer command line options.  Option format is:
          -PBdecimal
          -PB$hex
          -PB0xhex
     for example, -PB1000 means the same thing as -PB$3E8.

     Added logic to allow simple filenames as well as directory names in
     the upload duplication check file.  This allows quicker duplication
     checking over networks or CD-ROMS.

     Added logic to automatically cancel a link after repeated ACK
     timeout errors.

     Added logic to correctly handle the interrupt controller PIC
     register on exit when running on some multi-tasking systems.

     Added logic to give registered copies of hslink priority over
     unregistered copies when both sides of the link are using the -!
     (take priority) option.   Behavior in this situation used to be
     undefined.

     Added logic to ignore lines in -NO files that contain x:/....
     rather than x:\...., making it possible to use the same BLDLIST
     outputs in both hslink and prodoor systems.

     Added logic to leave NS16550 buffering enabled if it was found to
     already be enabled on program entry.

     Added logic to prevent block character devices (such as CON, NUL,
     CLOCK$, PRN, etc.) as transfer filenames.

     Added logic to prevent upload duplication prior to bidirectional
     transfers.  Without this feature, duplicate uploads will be
     completely received before the duplication is detected by the BBS.
     To enable this feature, use the option:
        -NOdirlist
     where 'dirlist' specifies the full pathname of a file containing
     one directory spec per line.  Each specified directory will then be
     checked for duplication with incoming files.  For example, PCBoard
     systems may use the option:
        -NOC:\PCB\GEN\DLPATH.LST
     to prevent upload duplication.  Use a program like MKDLIST.ZIP to
     create file lists for use with the -NO option.  This logic will
     check over 40000 files for duplicates in under 5 seconds on a
     386/20 machine.

     Added logic to reset the current transmit file when a file read
     error occurs.

     Added new DSZLOG codes to distinguish between transmit errors and
     receive errors. The new DSZLOG codes used are:
          'H'=file received from remote
          'h'=file transmitted to remote
          'E'=file receive was aborted
          'e'=file transmit was aborted (used to be 'E')
          'L'=lost carrier during file receive
          'l'=lost carrier during file transmit (used to be 'L')

     Added some logic to check for systems not using SHARE.

     Added support for -I, -N5, -NM and -NO options in HSCONFIG.

     Added support for high IRQ vectors (8-15) on AT class machines.

     Changed CPS calculation to properly account for skipped data during
     file transfer crash recovery.

     Changed CPS calculations to prevent numeric overflow at around 11megs.

     Changed DSZLOG entries to always include spaces with files over 1meg.

     Changed HSCONFIG to allow nonstandard base addresses in HEX.

     Changed HSLINK.EXE and HSCONFIG.EXE to search for HSLINK.CFG the
     following logic:
          1) search the current directory,
          2) search the directory where HSLINK.EXE is located
          3) search the PATH directories

     Changed crash recovery message in transmit window from "Seek to
     block" to "Crash recovery at block".

     Changed logic to include bargraphs even in unregistered copies of
     HS/Link, making unregistered copies fully functional.

     Changed settings display to say "COMx" rather than "COM1" when non-
     standard com port settings are being used.

     Corrected dropped characters during transmit with some internal
     modems. Thanks to Mark Talley and William Elliott for helping to
     track down this bug.

     Corrected final CPS calculation in outgoing files window when crash
     recovery is in effect.

     Corrections to prevent endless "ACK timeout" errors under some
     conditions.

     Corrections to prevent occasional '... was incomplete!' condition
     in the last file of a batch.

     Major documentation updates.

     Patched Borland's runtime library to prevent loss of interrupts
     during direct video screen updating.  This may eliminate the need
     for the -NV option in cases where overrun errors occur during
     screen updates.

     Removed supurflous "Please use -O with -R" message when files are
     rejected via -NO lists and user has requested -R.
