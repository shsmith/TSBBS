                           HSLINK 1.1 Registration

     This program is not free!  You are allowed to use this program for
     a trial period of 30 days free of charge.  If, after 30 days, you
     decide that you would like to continue using HSLINK, you must
     complete the following form and return it to the author with the
     required registration fee enclosed.

     Each HSLINK registration is valid for use on a single CPU or on a
     single BBS system (multi-node systems require only a single
     registration).

     The basic HSLINK registration cost is $20 US, which includes a
     registration certificate showing a Serial Number and Password.  You
     can use this certificate to "register" both current and future
     updates of the shareware version of HS/Link.

     A very nice printed and bound reference guide is available for $10
     per copy.

     For $25 US, a 5.25 disk containing the latest release of HSLINK,
     along with a registration certificate can be obtained.  Add $1 each
     for 3.5" disks instead of 5.25" disks.

     Be sure to add the correct shipping and handling charges for any
     disks or manuals you are ordering.  All orders are shipped by Air
     Mail.

     You can also register HS/Link with an Authorized HS/Link
     Distributor.  Refer to DISTRIB.DOC for a distributor near you.
