The file FHSLINK.EXE is the new FOSSIL version of the HS/Link protocol
driver.  It is identical to the standard HSLINK with the following
exceptions:

*  It appears that some FOSSIL implementations (including X00) accept
   both 0x11/0x13 _and_ 0x91/0x93 as the "XON/XOFF" codes, causing data
   loss when the handshake is enabled.  Because of this, the XON/XOFF
   handshake will not work with some FOSSIL drivers.  Include -HX -! in
   the command line to disable the handshake.  The Opus!Comm fossil
   appears to correctly handle this handshake, but early versions of X00
   do not.

*  You MUST specify the COM port opening speed with the -B option.  I
   was not able to reliably determine the current COM port speed using
   X00.  Future versions may remove this requirement.

*  The RTS handshake functions are not available in version 5 FOSSIL
   drivers, so the -HS option may not work.  Support has been added for
   X00 drivers, which do allow this type of handshake.

*  I recommend a FOSSIL transmit buffer size of at least 5k.  The
   receive buffer size is not as important, but should be increased if
   FHSLINK reports receiver overflow errors.

*  The -PB and -PI options are ignored since FOSSIL now controls all
   low-level COM port details.
