                       PROPOSED DISTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT

        This agreement is made between Samuel H. Smith ("Developer") and
        Arthur Mol ("Distributor"), and sets forth the terms and
        conditions pursuant to which Developer provides and Distributor
        accepts certain reproduction and resale rights for the software
        program, created and written by Developer, known as HSLINK version
        1.0 operating under the MS-DOS and PC-DOS operating systems
        ("Program").

        Developer hereby grants, and Distributor hereby accepts a
        nonexclusive, nontransferable, worldwide right to market, promote,
        reproduce and sell copies of Program.  Distributor agrees that
        each copy of Program sold will include a unique serial number
        ("License") obtained from Developer.

        Distributor agrees to request blocks of 20 or more Licenses, up to
        a total of 10000 Licenses, in writing, and Developer agrees to
        promptly deliver the requested Licenses to Distributor.  In
        exchange, Distributor agrees to pay all of Distributor's expenses
        of reproduction, packaging and marketing, and to pay to Developer
        royalties of $7.50, or 40% of sale price, whichever is greater,
        for each License which is sold by Distributor ("Royalties").

        Distributor agrees to hold Royalties in trust and to safeguard
        same in a reasonable manner, until disbursement to Developer.
        Disbursement of Royalties may occur at regular intervals as deemed
        to be convenient by Developer and Distributor, but must occur at
        least once during each calendar month.

        There will be no demands for compensation of individual time or
        expense or effort or reimbursement to Developer or Distributor
        except by mutual agreement in writing.

        Distributor may suggest, in writing, changes to be made in
        Program, and Developer agrees to consider such changes, and to
        make a good faith effort to satisfy the needs of Distributor, and
        to correct any reported errors in Program.  Developer retains all
        rights to set specifications for Program, including operational
        features which are directly visible to the user.

        This Letter of Agreement contains the whole, complete and only
        agreed contractual commitments by and between Developer and
        Distributor.

        Understanding that in any close working relationship, there can
        occur in the normal course of business a desire to extend agreed
        contracts to include additional understandings, or projects, for
        combined endeavors and commitments, those extensions must occur in
        writing and be exchanged and signed by both Developer and
        Distributor in order to be valid.


        In agreement to this contract and with full intent to abide by the
        terms set forth in this agreement, we do agree and pledge, and
        will honor the full spirit of this understanding, as it is
        written.



    To all these things I do so agree:
