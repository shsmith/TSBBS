      HS/Link is a high speed, full streaming, bidirectional, batch file
      transfer protocol with advanced Full-Streaming-Error-Correction.  Each
      side of the link is allowed to provide a list of files to be sent.  Files
      will be sent in BOTH directions until both sides of the link are
      satisfied.

      HS/Link is not just another bidirectional protocol, it is also a very
      fast protocol for normal downloading and uploading, incorporating some
      new ideas (such as Full-Streaming-Error-Correction and Dynamic-Code-
      Substitution) to make things happen a bit faster and with greater
      reliability.

      This program is not free!  You are hereby licensed to use this program
      for a trial period of 30 days free of charge.  If, after 30 days, you
      decide that you would like to continue using HSLINK, you must complete
      the registration form (REGISTER.FRM) and return it to the author with the
      required registration fee enclosed.

      Registration removes the "UNREGISTERED" and "PLEASE REGISTER" messages,
      as well as all time delays.  Registered copies broadcast their
      registration number to the remote unit.

      Please feel free to distribute HSLINK to your friends and local BBSes as
      long as all of the files in this archive are included and unmodified.

                                     Introduction
          _________________________________________________________________

      What is a file transfer protocol?

      A file transfer protocol is a means of transferring information from one
      computer to another.  The protocol has the responsibility of protecting
      against errors in transit, and taking measures to correct any errors that
      are detected.  The design and implementation of a protocol can make the
      difference between slow and unreliable communication, and fast and
      trouble free communication.

      Not all protocols are created equal.  With today's high speed modems,
      packet switched networks (such as PC Pursuit), and expensive long
      distance charges, users demand more than ever that files get through
      quickly and without corruption.

      The HS/Link protocol is the result of years of communication experience,
      and uses some very new and solid technology to see to it that you can
      easily move files as quickly as possible, and with the least amount of
      hassle.

      The HSLINK program can be used from the DOS command line, from BATCH
      files, or as an "external protocol" from most modern COMM programs and
      BBS programs.  If your favorite BBS does not yet support the HS/Link
      protocol, please ask your SYSOP to install it.

      Recent advances in high speed modem technology have made it possible to
      simultaneously transfer data at high speeds in both directions.  This
      standardized technology is called "V.32"
      or "V.32bis", and is available in many    ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      new modems.  Until HS/Link, these         ³Bidirectional features that³
      advanced modems were left half idle, due  ³really work...             ³
      to the single-direction nature of prior   ³HS/Link can simultaneously ³
      file transfer protocols.  The             ³send and receive files!    ³
      bidirectional capabilities of HS/Link     ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
      take full advantage of these modems,
      cutting online time as much as 50% when equal amounts of data are
      transmitted and received.

                               Summary of Key Features
          _________________________________________________________________

      ù Speed.
           HS/Link operates at or very near peak efficiency, often reaching 98%
           or more with pre-compressed files and non-buffered modems.  Even
           higher speeds are possible with buffered or error correcting modems. 
           A number of features, such as fast 32 bit CRC protection, Full-
           Streaming-Error-Recovery and Dynamic-Code-Substitution, combine to
           give maximum performance and security.

      ù Simple interface for beginners.
           In many cases, HS/Link requires only the COM port number and the
           filename to be transmitted.  Configuration files are not required. 
           The program is easily installed in most COMM programs that support
           external protocols.  The HSLINK program has multiple help screens,
           providing a quick reference to the basic and advanced command line
           options, including examples of how the program is used.

      ù Batch file transfers.
           The protocol can handle any size batch of files, and can take file
           specifications from either the command line or from a listing file.

      ù Bi-directional options that really work.
           The program can simultaneously upload and download with a single
           host request.  What's even better is how easy it is to use... 
           instead of a complex setup all you do is:

             1) Tell the BBS the names of the files you want to download, and
                then

             2) Press PGUP (or whatever your COMM program uses to UPLOAD files)
                and then tell your COMM program which files to upload

           By virtue of the BBS being told that it is sending files and your
           COMM program telling HS/Link that it too is sending files you then
           have a bidirectional transfer.  There's nothing else to set up.  You
           use the familiar BBS interface to request files to download and your
           COMM program's familiar interface to tell it which files to upload. 
           It couldn't get easier!

      ù Aborted file crash recovery.
           When desired, HS/Link can resume an aborted transfer, verifying all
           existing data blocks to insure the resumed file completely matches
           the file being transmitted.  This function can also update a file
           that has only a small number of changed, added, or deleted blocks.

          _________________________________________________________________

      When HS/Link is operating, it produces a full screen status display,
      divided into five windows.  For example:

      The first window contains the program identification and copyright.  When
      you register your copy of HSLINK, this window will also show the
      registered serial number.  Some warning messages may also appear in this
      window.

      The "Settings" window shows a summary of the various parameters that can
      be altered with command line options.

      The "InComing Files" window shows the status of files being received from
      the remote system.

      The "OutGoing Files" window shows the status of files being transmitted
      to the remote system.

      The "Batch Status" window summarizes overall session progress and
      estimates the time remaining for the selected files.

      To stop display bleedthrough under DesqView or DoubleDOS, use the -NV
      option to disable direct video writing.  

      If desired, the full screen status display can be turned off.  To do
      this, use the -NF command line option.  When running in -NF mode, a
      simple line-oriented status display will scroll down the screen.  This
      may be desired under some circumstances.

                                 Command Line Format
          _________________________________________________________________

      To run the HSLINK program, a command line must be given.  The command
      line has the following format:

      HSLINK [options] [SENDFILE] [@DRIVE:\PATH\FILELIST]

      SENDFILE  Indicates a list of files to be transmitted to remote computer. 
                The list may include the DOS wildcard characters '?' and '*'. 
                Specify ONLY files to be transmitted; received file names are
                determined automatically.

      @FILELIST Transmit list of files contained in FILELIST to remote
                computer.  This is used when you want to make a long list of
                files in advance, then transmit them all with a single command. 
                It is also used by BBS programs to produce long batches of
                downloads.

      ù    Anything shown in brackets "[]" is optional and may not need to be
           specified for proper operation of HS/Link.
      ù    The HSLINK command line is NOT case sensitive, and will work when
           typed in upper, lower or mixed case.
      ù    Please make sure that HSLINK.EXE is in a search PATH directory.

                              Basic Command Line Options
          _________________________________________________________________

      The most important command line options are -P (set COM port), -U (set
      download file directory), and -HS (enable slow handshake).

      -Pport    This option specifies which COM port you are using.
                Example:  -P2

      -Udir     This option controls the destination directory for downloaded
                files.  Without this option, all download files are placed into
                the current directory.
                Example:  -Uc:\bbsfiles

      -HS       Handshake Slow (send XOFF and/or lower RTS during disk I/O). 
                This option may be required if your computer is unable to
                simultaneously access the disk and the COM port.  If you see
                frequent CRC error messages, even on clean phone lines, you
                probably need to include -HS in your command line.

      To abort an HS/Link transfer, press Control-X four or more times.

                                 Configuration Files
          _________________________________________________________________

      Because of the large number of possible command line options, it is
      possible to store frequently used command options in a configuration
      file.  This eliminates the need to        ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      repeatedly type the options at a command  ³HS/Link does NOT require³
      line.  If you are calling HSLINK from     ³configuration files.    ³
      multiple batch files, you can also use    ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
      configuration files to store "common"
      options, that can be changed in one place rather than separately in the
      various batch files.

      HSLINK will first search the current for
      the HSLINK.CFG file.  If not found, it    ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      will then search the directory where      ³For best results, add your ³
      HSLINK.EXE is stored, followed by all     ³HS/Link or COMM program    ³
      directories in the DOS PATH setting. If   ³directory to your PATH     ³
      the HSLINK.CFG file is found, each file   ³statement.                 ³
      line is loaded as a command line option.  ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


      If you want to use an alternate configuration file, use the -@fname
      command line option, which will cause 'fname' to be loaded.  For example:
           HSLINK -@C:\WORK\TOLAP.CFG
      will cause HSLINK to use C:\WORK\TOLAP.CFG as the configuration file.


      If -@fname is not the first command line option, the default HSLINK.CFG
      file will be searched for and loaded before the specified configuration
      file.


      Use -@ (without a filename) to prevent HSLINK from searching for a
      configuration file, slightly speeding operation on systems that have a
      long search PATH setting in effect.


      To aid in creation and alteration of
      configuration files, the HS/Link          ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿

 Can't find: C:\UTIL\HSLINK.CFG


      HSCONFIG can be used to edit any configuration file, but the default is
      to edit HSLINK.CFG in the current directory, or the same directory in
      which HSLINK.EXE is found.  If you want to edit some other configuration
      file, you must specify the filename on the HSCONFIG command line.  For
      example:

           HSCONFIG TOLAP.CFG

      will create or edit TOLAP.CFG, which can later be used by HSLINK with a
      command line like this:

           HSLINK -@TOLAP.CFG

      When no configuration filename is specified, and the default
      configuration file HSLINK.CFG cannot be located, it will automatically be
      created in the same directory that HSLINK.EXE is found in.  If you wish
      to create the configuration file in a different directory, you must
      explicitly specify the directory/filename to be used on the HSCONFIG
      command line.

                            Advanced Command Line Options
          _________________________________________________________________

      The HS/Link protocol program has a number of command line options, most
      of which are rarely needed, or which are provided for advanced users to
      obtain maximum performance and flexibility.

      -@fname
           Uses fname as an alternate configuration file.  Each line in the
           specified file may contain a single command line option.  The
           default is to search PATH directories for HSLINK.CFG.

      -!
           Take priority.  Locally specified -A, -HX, -S, and -W settings will
           be used by the remote system.

      -A
           Disable transmission of ACK codes after each block.  This may
           improve transfer speeds under some conditions.

      -Bbaud
           COM port opening baud rate 300-      ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
           115200 (default=current port OPEN    ³Don't use the -B option if ³
           speed).                              ³you don't need to!  In most³
           This option controls the speed at    ³cases HS/Link is able to   ³
           which the COM port will be opened.   ³automatically determine the³
                                                ³proper port opening speed. ³
           Normally, the COM port speed can be  ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
           determined from hardware and need
           not be specified.

      -C
           Disable carrier detect checking.  Use this option when directly
           connecting two machines via a null modem cable.

      -CBcolor
           Defines the border color in full screen mode.

      -CMcolor
           Defines the main screen color in full screen mode.

      -CTcolor
           Defines the window title color in full screen mode.

      -CWcolor
           Defines the window contents color in full screen mode.

      -CGcolor
           Defines the file and batch progress bargraph color in full screen
           mode.

      -Ebaud
           Effective modem-to-modem baud rate.
           This is used to estimate transfer times, and is included in the
           DSZLOG output.  (default=current -B setting)

      -FC
           Force CTS hardware handshake.
           This option prevents HSLINK from automatically disabling CTS
           hardware handshake if CTS is not active initially.

      -HC
           Disables CTS hardware handshake.
           CTS transmitter handshake is automatically enabled, but may conflict
           with some unusual modem cables or serial ports.  If the CTS signal
           is not active when HSLINK loads, it will automatically disable CTS
           handshake for you.  Use the -HC command to manually disable CTS
           handshake.

      -HR
           Disables RTS hardware handshake.
           RTS receiver handshake is used when the slow-handshake option is
           selected.  This form of handshake causes the RTS line to the modem
           to be lowered whenever the disk is being accessed.  Some unusual
           modem or cable arrangements may not tolerate the RTS line being
           lowered.  In this case, the RTS handshake can be disabled with the -
           HR option.

      -HS
           Handshake Slow (send XOFF and/or lower RTS during disk I/O).
           The slow handshake option is available for systems with slow disk
           access.  Use this if you get frequent CRC errors or COM Overrun
           errors on otherwise clean lines.  The slow handshake option causes
           XOFF to be sent and/or RTS to be lowered during any disk activity. 
           Even when -HS is active, the HS/Link protocol should transfer data
           very nearly as fast as the slowest part of the link allows.

      -HX
           Disable XON/XOFF handshake.
           XON/XOFF handshake is a software handshake scheme that should work
           well on all combinations of modems and networks, and is enabled by
           default.  If you prefer not to use XON/XOFF handshake, or you find
           that it is not required for error-free transfer, you can disable it
           with the -HX option.

           Note that both the sender and the receiver must simultaneously
           disable XON/XOFF handshake, otherwise it will remain in effect.

      -Iidle
           This option controls how idle time is given up under multitasking
           environments.  The possible values are:
                -I0  Default, do not give up idle time
                -I1  Spend idle time checking keyboard status
                -I2  Give up idle time under DesqView
                -I3  Give up idle time under DoubleDOS
           Some network server software, such as LanTastic, performs best when
           the -I1 option is used.

      -K
           Keep partial files from aborted transfers.

      -LFlogfile
           Specify status log file.
           This option allows you to override the DSZLOG environment variable
           to specify the file to be used for status logging. Omit this option,
           or leave blank to control this function through the DSZLOG
           environment variable.

      -N5
           This option causes HS/Link to disable NS16550 buffering logic.  This
           option may be needed with some early versions, or incorrect clone
           versions of the NS16550 chip, which do not properly perform
           buffering.

      -NB
           Disable buffering of receive and transmit files.  The default is to
           divide approximately 24k of memory between InComing and OutGoing
           files.

      -NC
           Disable Dynamic Code Substitution logic.
           Certain byte codes cannot be transmitted directly over the COM link.
           For instance, the codes for Control-X, Control-S and Control-Q must
           be "escaped" to prevent a conflict with flow or program control.

           The HS/Link protocol uses a new Dynamic Code Substitution system to
           drastically reduce the number protocol overhead and "escape" codes
           needed to transmit certain data streams.

           Highly compressed data files (such as ZIP and GIF files) benefit the
           most, since they often have many byte codes that cannot be
           transmitted directly over the COM link.

      -NF
           Disable Full screen mode.  The standard status display takes over
           the full screen (except the top 2 lines, which may contain a BBS
           status line).  

           This option bypasses the full screen display and causes a line-
           oriented output to be used.  Use this option if your environment's
           screen management does not allow a full-screen display.

      -NM
           Enable Minimal Blocks logic.  Use    ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
           with caution.  This option is        ³HS/Link's Full Screen    ³
           recommended for use only on error-   ³status display does not  ³
           corrected links, such as with MNP    ³alter the first 2 display³
           or V.42 connections.                 ³lines.  The last display ³
                                                ³line is also left alone. ³
      -NT                                       ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
           Stamp current file time.   This
           option stamps the current time/date on received files, instead of
           retaining the original file time/date.

      -NOdirlist
           Incoming file duplication checklist.

           This option allows you to check incoming files for duplication in a
           list of directories.  This feature prevents incoming files from
           duplicating files in directories other than the current -U setting.

           The dirlist is a text file which contains one filename or directory
           specification per line.  See MKDLIST documentation for special
           instructions to speed CD-ROM duplication checking.

      -NU
           Block uploads.   This option is used by BBS programs that cannot
           (yet) cope with bidirectional uploads.  It is used in place of the -
           U option on the 'download' command line, and has the effect of
           blocking any simultaneous upload requests from a user.

      -NV
           Disable direct Video for             ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
           DesqView/DoubleDOS/etc.  Use this    ³You may need to use -NV  ³
           option if you experience "bleeding"  ³to stop display bleeding.³
           of the status display from one       ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ  
           partition to another.  

      -O
           Allow receive files to overwrite existing files.

      -Pport
           Use COM port 1-8 (default=1).   Standard COM port definitions:
                Channel   I/O Port  Interrupt
                 COM1      0x3F8     4
                 COM2      0x2F8     3
                 COM3      0x3E8     4
                 COM4      0x2E8     3
                 COM5      undefined
                 COM6      undefined
                 COM7      0x2E8     5
                 COM8      0x3E8     5
           Use -PB and -PI instead of -P to define a non-standard COM port.

      -PBbase
           Set non-standard COM port base address.  Base addresses may be
           specified in either decimal or hex.  Hex addresses must begin with $
           or 0x.  For example, -PB1000, -PB$3E8 and -PB0x3E8 all specify the
           same port base address.

      -PIirq
           Set non-standard COM port IRQ level to 1-15.  This option must be
           used when -PB is used.  IRQ levels 8-15 are supported only on AT
           class machines with cascaded interrupt controllers.

      -R
           Resume aborted transfer.  The        ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
           receiver and transmitter will        ³Use -R -K -O if you want³
           verify the contents of an existing   ³Download Crash Recovery ³
           file, and will begin transmission    ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
           at the first block that does not
           match.  This provides a reliable means of restarting an aborted
           transfer, or of updating a modified file.  You must also use -O to
           recover aborted downloads.

      -Ssize
           Sets transmit block size 2-4096 (default=1024) Larger block sizes
           may result in higher transfer speeds under clean line conditions.

      -Udir
           Destination directory for received files (default=current directory)

      -Wwindow
           Number of blocks allowed without     ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
           ACK 1-1000 (default=8)               ³Use -W4 -S512 -! with ³
           Use -A to establish an "infinite"    ³PC-Pursuit            ³
           window (i.e. no ACK required at      ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
           all).

           The "ACK window" is the number of blocks that will be sent to the
           modem before an ACKnowledge code is required.  If the specified
           number of blocks have been sent and no ACK has yet been received,
           output will be suspended until the ACK is received or the link times
           out.  This provides a form of software flow control that works well
           when parts of the link are very slow compared to other parts, such
           as when PC Pursuit is in use.

           The /w:XXX value displayed in the InComing Files window reports the
           actual number of blocks that are being transmitted prior to
           acknowledge.  Setting the -W value higher than the highest /w:XXX
           value observed will have no further effect on transfer thruput.

                                   BBS Requirements
          _________________________________________________________________

      HS/Link's demands on a bulletin board program are extremely easy to fill. 
      The following is all that is necessary:

      1)   The protocol accepts either a
           filename to download or a list of    ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
           files of the form                    ³Send file lists are text³
           @DRIVE:\PATH\DOWNLIST.LST.  The      ³files that contain one  ³
           protocol will send only the          ³path/filename per line. ³
           specified files if filenames         ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
           (without leading @) are given, or
           all of the files found in
           C:\BBS\DOWNLIST.LST if @C:\BBS\DOWNLIST.LST is specified.

      2)   The protocol will create a DSZLOG compatible log file indicating the
           names of all files transferred as well as their status (refer to the
           DSZ standard and the "DSZLOG Statistic Logging" section for the
           specific contents of the file).

      3)   Any files found in the DSZLOG file
           which BBS did not tell the protocol  ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
           to SEND are assumed to have instead  ³HS/Link does NOT modify  ³
           been RECEIVED by the protocol.  The  ³BBS upload listings!     ³
           BBS should then check for the        ³The BBS program must     ³
           existence of such files and if       ³detect uploads and do    ³
           found, ask for descriptions and      ³it's own file management.³
           post them in the upload directory.   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


      If the BBS program is not yet able to
      cope with bidirectional uploads, the -NU  ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      option can be used on the 'download'      ³Use -NU to block all  ³
      command line to prevent attempts to       ³bidirectional uploads.³
      perform a bidirectional upload.           ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

                                     Flow Control
          _________________________________________________________________

      Flow Control is required when the sending and receiving computers or
      modems operate at different speeds, or when computers are unable to
      simultaneously access disk drives and the COM port.  Flow Control is a
      software and/or hardware means of slowing down the faster parts of the
      connection to prevent overloading the slower parts of the system.

      HS/Link uses both XON/XOFF (software) and RTS/CTS (hardware) handshake
      when communicating with high speed modems or slow packet switched
      networks.  The protocol also uses a window algorithm to suspend data
      transmission if the receiver does not eventually respond to transmitted
      data.

      XON/XOFF handshake is a software handshake scheme that should work well
      on all combinations of modems and networks, and is enabled by default. 
      If you prefer not to use XON/XOFF handshake, or you find that it is not
      required for error-free transfer, you can disable it with the -HX option. 
      Note that both the sender and the receiver must simultaneously disable
      XON/XOFF handshake, otherwise it will remain in effect.

      The slow handshake option (-HS) is available for systems with slow disk
      access.  Use this if you get frequent CRC errors or COM Overrun errors on
      otherwise clean lines.  The slow handshake option causes XOFF to be sent
      and/or RTS to be lowered during any disk
      activity.  Even when -HS is active, the   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      HS/Link protocol should transfer data     ³The -HS option stops most  ³
      very nearly as fast as the slowest part   ³Overrun and CRC errors that³
      of the link allows.                       ³occur during or immediately³
                                                ³after disk I/O takes place.³
      CTS transmitter handshake is              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
      automatically enabled, but may conflict
      with some unusual modem cables or serial ports.  If the CTS signal is not
      active when HSLINK loads, it will automatically disable CTS handshake for
      you.  Use the -HC command to manually disable CTS handshake.

      RTS receiver handshake is used when the slow-handshake option is
      selected.  This form of handshake causes the RTS line to the modem to be
      lowered whenever the disk is being accessed.  Some unusual modem or cable
      arrangements may not tolerate the RTS line being lowered.  In this case,
      the RTS handshake can be disabled with the -HR option.

      If you have frequent CRC errors or COM Overrun errors, which persist in
      spite of the handshake-slow option (-HS), you should consider upgrading
      your serial port from the usual 8250 to a newer, buffered NS16550AN chip. 
      The buffered chips are highly recommended if you are operating at high
      baud rates (>9600) or are accessing extended memory or are multi-tasking.

      I have also had reports that use of large numbers of dos BUFFERS in
      CONFIG.SYS can cause overrun errors.  Try reducing the BUFFERS setting to
      10 or less, especially if you also use a DISK cache.

      Some disk cache programs have also been reported to cause overrun errors. 
      Try turning the cache OFF before calling HSLINK, and turning it back ON
      again after the transfer is completed.





                                 Buffered ASYNC chips
          _________________________________________________________________

      The National NS16550AN is a pin compatible plug in replacement for 8250
      and 16450 serial chips.  It contains hardware buffering to allow faster
      operation in systems with high interrupt service latency.

      If you have an NS16550AN buffered UART
      chip, HS/Link will automatically enable   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      buffering for better performance with     ³The NS16550AN chip stops   ³

                           Full Streaming Data Transmission
          _________________________________________________________________

      The HS/Link protocol allows multiple data blocks to be transmitted before
      an acknowledgement is required by use of block numbers combined with a
      window algorithm.

      The protocol also allows acknowledgements to be combined with data
      flowing in the opposite direction, making it possible to achieve full
      streaming simultaneously in both directions over a full duplex
      communication link.

      Even though the transmitters operate in full streaming mode, the
      receivers normally will periodically acknowledge that data is being
      received.  This acknowledgement can be disabled with the -A option.

      Recent advances in high speed modem technology have made it possible to
      simultaneously transfer data at high      ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      speeds in both directions.  This          ³The HST modem is not well  ³
      standardized technology is called "V.32"  ³suited for bidirectional   ³
      or "V.32bis", and are available in many   ³transfers.  Switch to V.32 ³
      new modems.  The bidirectional            ³modes, if available, for   ³
      capabilities of HS/Link take full         ³higher thru-put.           ³

      online time as much as 50% when equal
      amounts of data are transmitted and received.

      Some older high speed modems, such as the HST and Hayes-V, do not
      implement V.32 and are able to transfer quickly in only one direction,
      while the other direction is relatively slow.  HS/Link will still perform
      well as a single direction protocol with these modems, but bidirectional
      thruput will be low due to the "ping
      pong" effect of the modem switching the   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      high speed channel back and forth.        ³The "Ping Pong" effect  ³

                            Full Streaming Error Recovery
          _________________________________________________________________

      The HS/Link protocol has the unique ability to recover from many
      transmission errors without breaking out of full streaming mode.

      This is important with buffered modems or packet switched networks with
      long turnaround times.

      Conventional protocols, such as Zmodem, simply reposition the transmitter
      after an error, requiring a retransmission of not only the erroneous
      data, but also the entire stream of data that was in transit at the time
      the error was detected.

      The HS protocol can correct bad blocks
      without retransmitting intermixed good    ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      blocks, resulting in excellent transfer   ³Full-Streaming-Error-      ³
      speeds under moderate line noise          ³Correction cannot stop flow³
      conditions.                               ³control failure-related    ³

                              Dynamic Code Substitution
          _________________________________________________________________

      Certain byte codes cannot be transmitted directly over the COM link.  For
      instance, the codes for Control-X, Control-S and Control-Q must be
      "escaped" to prevent a conflict with flow or program control.

      The HS/Link protocol uses a new Dynamic Code Substitution system to
      drastically reduce number protocol overhead and "escape" codes needed to
      transmit certain data streams.

      Highly compressed data files (such as ZIP and GIF files) benefit the
      most, since they often have many byte codes that cannot be transmitted
      directly over the COM link.

      The Dynamic Code Substitution feature can be disabled, if you wish, with
      the -NC option.




                            Transmission of Minimal Blocks
          _________________________________________________________________

      The HS/Link protocol includes a Minimal
      Blocks feature, which when activated,     ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      causes the protocol to strip away         ³Enable Minimal-Blocks with ³
      repeated information from the protocol    ³the -NM option only if you ³
      frames and transmit only the minimal      ³are operating with an error³
      amount of information required for data   ³free link.                 ³
      flow.                                     ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

      This feature results in a savings of over 50% of the normal protocol
      overhead characters in each block of data, while retaining full data
      integrity.  All data and control blocks are fully protected by a 32 bit
      CRC calculation, even when Minimal Blocks is in effect.

      The final block in a file rarely ends on an exact transfer block
      boundary.  The HS/Link protocol automatically shortens the final block,
      eliminating extraneous data transmission at the end of file.

                               DSZLOG Statistic Logging
          _________________________________________________________________

      When you define the environment variable DSZLOG, the HSLINK program will
      enable transfer logging to the specified filename.  The log file can also
      be set with the -FL option.  For example, the AUTOEXEC statement:
           SET DSZLOG=C:\LOGS\LOG.OUT
      will cause HSLINK to log files transmitted to C:\LOGS\LOG.OUT.  This form
      of logging provides compatibility with programs that are designed to
      operate with DSZ or other DSZLOG-type protocols.

      The log file consists of a single line of text for each file transferred. 
      Here are some sample log entries:

 h 227596 10100 bps 1138 cps   0 errors   112 2316 V:\UPLOAD\ZLABP_13.ZIP 0
 H 177901 10100 bps 1116 cps   1 errors     0  749 U:\PLAY1\ECOMM22.ZIP 0

 L 136991 10100 bps    0 cps   0 errors    55 1823 W:\ULW\WINDE223.ZIP 11
 E 152614 10100 bps    0 cps  14 errors    22   38 W:\ULW\CLPGR21C.ZIP 0 2

      Each line contains the following fields:

      Size      Description
      ----      -------------------------------------------
      1         'H'=file received from remote
                'h'=file sent to remote
                'E'=file receive was aborted
                'e'=file transmit was aborted
                'L'=lost carrier during file receive
                'l'=lost carrier during file transmit

      7         The length of the file, in bytes.   If the transfer was
                aborted, this field will contain the number of bytes
                transferred before the transfer was aborted.

      6         The effective modem-to-modem connect speed.
      4         Literally ' bps'

      5         The average transfer rate, in characters per second.
      4         Literally ' cps'

      4         The total number of blocks which required retransmission during
                the transfer.
      7         Literally ' errors'

      6         The number of flow control restrictions.
      5         The length of the last block transferred in the file.
      ?         The full pathname of the file which was transferred.
      ?         The Serial Number of the remote HSLINK, if registered.

                                Network Compatibility
          _________________________________________________________________

      All file processing is fully network and
      "share" compatible.  HSLINK can be        ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      easily installed in multi-user or         ³HS/Link automatically   ³
      networked computers.  This works with     ³enables file sharing in ³
      DOS version 3.0 and later.                ³network environments.   ³
                                                ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

      When transmitting a file, the file is opened in "allow read, deny none"
      mode.

      When receiving a file, the newly created file is created in "allow read,
      allow write, deny all" mode, which prevents other programs from altering
      the file which is being created.

      If a file sharing violation is detected when opening a file, the program
      passes control to the system's current "critical error" handler.  To
      automate recovery from file sharing violations, you should consider
      installing my FATAL14.ZIP program, which will automatically retry after
      sharing violations, and which will keep a detailed log of all critical
      errors in a system since the time the program was loaded into memory.

      All files transmitted or received with HS/Link retain their original
      exact size and time/date stamp.  No extraneous data is added beyond EOF
      as with some older protocols.  The current date/time will be stamped on
      incoming files if the -NT option is used.  Otherwise, the original file's
      time/date stamp will be retained.

      When run under DOS 2.x, HSLINK automatically reverts to non-share file
      modes.

                                   Auto Downloading
          _________________________________________________________________

      It is possible for some terminal
      programs to support HS/Link auto          ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
      downloading by means of "scripts" which   ³With HS/Link Auto-Download ³
      wait for the HS/Link "ready" packet, and  ³You don't have to hit any  ³
      then shell out to the HSLINK receiver     ³additional keys to execute ³
      protocol.                                 ³the HSLINK driver.         ³
                                                ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

      This capability is currently active when HS/Link is installed in {COMMO}
      and BOYAN 5.0, any may be available soon under many other terminal
      programs as the respective authors add the capability to recognize
      external protocol signon signatures.


      The HS/Link "ready" packet is repeated at 10 second intervals when
      waiting for the HSLINK receiver to be started.  The format of the "ready"
      packet is:

           "HS*" ^B "R"
      or in hex,
           0x02 0x52

      When this sequence of characters is received during a terminal 
      session, the HSLINK protocol should be executed.


      The HSLINK program sends a different "ready" packet when no files need to
      be sent, but upload files are expected from the remote system.  This
      "ready" packet signature can be used to implement HS/Link Automatic
      Upload.  The format of the "upload ready" packet is:

           "HS*" ^B "Q"
      or in hex,
           0x02 0x51

      When this sequence of characters is received during a terminal session,
      an HS/Link upload should be started.   The three character prefix "HS*"
      was added with version 1.1 and is needed only if the shorter 2 character
      signatures are being used for another purpose.

                                    Error Messages
          _________________________________________________________________

      Bad ____ CRC
           These messages indicate that an error was detected in a control
           message between the sender and the receiver.  All control packets
           are protected by a 32 bit CRC calculation to provide highly secure
           and reliable communication.

           If you repeatedly receive the "Bad ready packet CRC" message, it may
           indicate that the internal protocol formats have been changed and
           that you need to upgrade to a newer beta copy of HSLINK.

      Bad data CRC (#)
      Dropped bytes -# (#)
      Noise burst # (#)
           These messages indicate that an error was detected in a block of
           data in the file being received.  "Dropped bytes" indicates that
           some expected bytes did not arrive, and "Noise burst" indicates that
           more bytes than expected arrived.  Error correction is automatic,
           because of Full-Streaming-Error-Correction, may occur without
           breaking the stream of data being received.

           If this message occurs at regular intervals, it is a sign of flow
           control failure.  In most cases, this can be corrected with the
           addition of the -HS command line option.

      COM#: Break!
      COM#: Framing!
      COM#: Overrun!
      COM#: Parity!
           These messages indicate that an error was detected in the serial
           port receiver.  Framing and Parity errors often indicate a baud rate
           mismatch.  Overrun errors usually indicate the need for flow control
           or for an upgrade to a buffered serial chip.  Overrun errors can
           often be reduced or eliminated with the use of the -HS command line
           option.

      Can't create file '___'
           This indicates that the received file could not be created.  This
           usually indicates that the directory specified in the -U command
           line option is invalid, or that the disk is full.

      Carrier lost!
           This indicates that Carrier detect was dropped, aborting the HSLINK
           session.  If your connection does not provide a carrier detect
           signal, you can disable this check with the -C command line option. 
           This is often required when directly connecting two computers by
           means of a "null modem" cable.

      Control-X abort!
           This indicates that the control-x character was received twice in
           succession, either over the COM port or from the local keyboard.

      Disk write failure!  (#)
           This usually indicates that the disk is full and that further
           downloads cannot be received.

      Flow control released (#### t:# r:#)
           If output flow has been suspended by either software or hardware
           flow control for more than 15 seconds, the program will assume that
           there has been a failure of flow control and will release the hold
           so data can continue.  The codes in parenthesis indicate which flow
           controls were active at the time (C=CTS was down, T=transmitter XOFF
           was pending, R=receiver XOFF was pending, A=transmitter is currently
           active) and the counts of bytes in the transmit and receive holding
           queues.

      FILE was incomplete!  (# #)
           This message indicates that the transfer was aborted in some way
           before the specified file was completely received.  Normally
           incomplete files are erased from disk, but they will be retained of
           the -K command line option is used.

      Not allowed to overwrite existing file '___'
           This indicates that a file was received but there was another file
           with the same name already in the download file directory.  Either
           erase the duplicate file, or use the -O option to allow existing
           files to be overwritten.

      Insufficient memory to load program.
      Not enough memory!
           There was not enough memory available to run HSLINK.  Free
           additional memory by removing "TSR" software, device drivers,
           ramdisks or disk caches.  If your COMM program has the option of
           swapping to DISK or EMS, enable the option to free additional memory
           for HSLINK's use.  Current beta copies of HSLINK require about 64k
           of RAM, but the specific amount of memory required is subject to
           change from beta to beta.  You can reduce the amount of memory
           required if you use the -NB command line option to disable file
           buffering.

      Read failure at #
           This indicates that there was a disk error reading a file being
           transmitted.

      Remote not responding!
           This indicates that the remote computer did not execute HSLINK and
           establish a connection within the two minute timeout period.

                                 Information Messages
          _________________________________________________________________

      Receive timeout (#)
      ACK timeout, resend #
           This message indicates that it has been too long since the receiver
           responded to data transmission.  The last data block is repeated in
           an attempt to wake up the receiver.

      Block size: #
           This message indicates the actual block size being used for file
           transfers.  The block size is controlled by the -W parameter, and
           may be overridden by the remote computer if the remote uses the -! 
           (take priority) option.

      COM#: # bps
           This message indicates the actual COM port speed in use, either as
           specified with the -B command line option, or as determined from the
           current hardware settings.

      HS/Link finished! (t:# r:#) Exit code = #
           When HSLINK terminates, it sets the dos ERRORLEVEL to the specified
           value.  This can be checked in batch files to detect error
           conditions.  Under normal conditions, HSLINK exits with an
           ERRORLEVEL of 0.  If, however, the session terminated due to errors,
           or was aborted by the operator, the ERRORLEVEL will be non-0.  The
           following ERRORLEVEL codes are possible:

           ERRORLEVEL          Reason for link termination
           ----------          ----------------------------------------

           COMM and BBS programs should use the DSZLOG output file to determine
           more specific details of transfer results.  

           The (t:# r:#) display indicates the number of files successfully
           transmitted and received.

      File received OK, # cps, # seconds.
           The file was received correctly and is now closed.  The average
           transfer speed is calculated based on the elapsed time between
           receiving the file open packet and the last byte of the file. 
           Transfer speeds are calculated using the DOS timer tick, which is
           not accurate for transfers taking less than 1 second to complete. 
           For very short transfers, a cps rating of 9999 will be returned.

      File sent OK, # cps, # seconds.
           The file was transmitted correctly and is now closed.  The average
           transfer speed is calculated based on the elapsed time between
           sending the first byte of the file and the last byte of the file. 
           Transfer speeds are calculated using the DOS timer tick, which is
           not accurate for transfers taking less than 1 second to complete. 
           For very short transfers, a cps rating of 9999 will be returned.

      File skipped!
           The transmitter prints this message when the receiver requests the
           current file be skipped.  This usually happens when the receiver
           detects a duplicate filename and is not allowed to overwrite
           existing files.

      Handshake: CTS XON/XOFF SLOW
           This message indicates the current combination of flow control
           options that are in effect.  CTS indicates CTS hardware flow control
           is active.  XON/XOFF indicates that XON/XOFF software flow control
           is active.  SLOW indicates that flow will be restrained during disk
           I/O to prevent overrun errors.

      Out of sequence # (#)
           This indicates that the received block was out of sequence,
           indicating that a block was possibly missed or lost during
           transmission.  The receiver will request the transmitter to
           retransmit the missing block(s).

      Received block # (# bytes) # cps
           This displays the current status of the file being received.  The
           current number of blocks and bytes received is displayed after each
           block is received.  The estimated transfer speed in ch/sec is also
           displayed.

      Received block # (# bytes) E#
           When "E#" is displayed following the received block # message, it
           indicates that error recovery is in progress, and that the specified
           block number was in error and is in transit from the transmitter. 
           When the erroneous block has been received correctly the E# display
           will advance to the next erroneous block number, or will be erased
           if no more erroneous blocks are pending.
      Received block # (# bytes) R
           When "R" is displayed following the received block # message, it
           indicates that current block has been previously received correctly
           and is therefore a "repeat" block.  Repeat blocks occur under severe
           error conditions and are usually corrected automatically.

      Receiving file: ___ (# blocks, # bytes)
           This message indicates that a new file is being received from the
           transmitter.  The file size is displayed in blocks and bytes.

      Resending block #
           This message indicates that the receiver has detected an erroneous
           block and is requesting a retransmission to correct the data.  Data
           flow continues where it left off prior to the resend, allowing error
           recovery to take place without breaking out of full streaming mode
           and without discarding data that is already in transit to the
           receiver.  This is the basis of Full- Streaming-Error-Correction.

      Restarting current file
           This indicates that the receiver was unable to recover from errors
           encountered in processing the current file being transmitted, and
           has requested that the file be started again from scratch.

      Seek from block # to #
           Under the most severe error conditions, the receiver may request the
           transmitter to discard data that is in transit to the receiver and
           to rewind to an earlier position in the file and resume
           transmission.

      Sending block # (# bytes/w:#) # cps
           This is the normal status display while a file is being transmitted. 
           The message indicates the latest block number to be transmitted, and
           in parenthesis indicates the number of bytes transmitted and the
           current number of blocks that have been transmitted without
           acknowledgement, which represents the size of the transmit "window"
           that is currently in use.  If this value hangs at the current -W
           setting, you may benefit from a higher -W setting on the command
           line.  The estimated transfer speed is also reported in ch/sec.

      Sending file: ___ (# blocks, # bytes)
           This message indicates that a new file is being transmitted to the
           receiver.  The file size is displayed in blocks and bytes.

      Transfer aborted!
           This message indicates that the current file transfer has been
           aborted for some reason.  The specific reason for the transfer abort
           is usually also printed on the screen.

      Waiting for remote.
           This message indicates that HSLINK is waiting to handshake with the
           remote computer.  HSLINK will wait for 60 seconds for the other
           computer to come online; after that the transfer is aborted.

      Warning: CTS signal missing!  -HC will be assumed.
           The CTS hardware handshake is normally enabled by default.  If, on
           initial loading, HSLINK finds that the CTS signal is down, it
           assumes that the current hardware configuration is not using CTS
           handshake and automatically disables further CTS handshake checks. 
           Use the -HC command line to manually disable CTS handshake.

      Window: #
           This indicates the actual number of blocks that are allowed to be in
           transit without acknowledgement.  This is controlled by the -W
           parameter, and may be overridden by the remote computer if the
           remote uses the -!  (take priority) option.

      Window: NONE
           This indicates that the -A command line option has been specified,
           and that the transmitter is required to continue indefinitely
           without receiving any kind of acknowledgement from the receiver that
           data is being received correctly.
