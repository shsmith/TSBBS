       HIGH SPEED LINK bidirectional protocol adds "CHAT" in version 1.2.


         LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA -- THE TOOL SHOP announced the release of
    HS/Link version 1.2.  HS/Link is a file transfer protocol driver capable
    of simultaneous "CHAT", transmission of computer files, and reception of
    files, at high speeds.  HS/Link has built-in error correction and is
    easily installed in most telecommunication programs and bulletin board
    systems.  Bidirectional file transfer means that uploading and
    downloading of files can take place simultaneously, thus reducing file
    transfer time up to 50% on many long distance phone calls.

         The HS/Link protocol is now used on thousands of bulletin board
    systems worldwide, and is frequently used to transport large volumes of
    message traffic in echo networks.

         HS/Link requires an IBM PC or compatible computer running MS DOS
    versions 2.1 or later.  Works with any type modem or direct connection
    at speeds up to 115200.  Supports NS16550AN buffered UART, if available.
    Works with most available terminal or BBS software.  A "FOSSIL" version
    is also available.  A version specifically written for "PROCOMM PLUS FOR
    WINDOWS" is due to be released later this year.

         HS/Link is available from Samuel H. Smith DBA The Tool Shop, P.O.
    Box 4808, Los Angeles, CA 91412-4808.  Phone orders are accepted at
    (213) 851-9969 or using a modem at (213) 851-2127.  The HS/Link 1.2
    suggested list price is $47 (includes DISK and printed manual).

         HS/Link is also available in shareware form with a $15 (NO DISK)
    basic registration fee.
