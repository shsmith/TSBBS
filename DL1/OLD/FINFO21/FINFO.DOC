Revision History
----------------

10-20-88 v1.5
   Changed for compilation under Zortech C++.
   Zortech's printf function tends to get quite confused when a %s parameter
   contains certain characters.  Recoded to output descriptions character-by-
   character.  Hopefully this will eliminate all possibility of descriptions
   being lost due to garbage characters.

01-03-88 v1.6
   Fixed a bug that prevented stamping a file dated after 1-31-88.

07-04-89 v2.0
   Rewrite in Turbo Pascal.  Now about 1/2 the size and somewhat faster.
   Added additional checks for invalid file dates.
   Added a check for an optional (hh:mm) at beginning of description.

01-04-91 v2.1
   Changed to allow dates later than 12-31-90.
