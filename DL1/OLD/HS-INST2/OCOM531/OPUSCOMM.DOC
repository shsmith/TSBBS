The files in this archive are:

  OpusComm.Com - FOSSIL Level 5 driver.  Can handle 2 serial ports.
  OpusCom1.Com - FOSSIL Level 5 driver.  Can handle either Com1 or Com2.
  Ocom_Cfg.Exe - OpusComm configurator.  Run this without parameters to
                 get a brief summary of what it can do.

OpusComm is a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program that
implements the functionality of a FOSSIL driver as described in the
file FOSSIL.DOC included in the FOSSILV5.ARC archive.  To use this
driver, just run the .Com file corresponding to the number of ports to
be supported.  If you are only running one comm port, use OpusCom1.
The Ocom_Cfg program can be used to further configure the FOSSIL driver
to meet your needs.  This program can ONLY be used with OpusComm drivers,
and will not work at all with other FOSSIL drivers.

Beginning with Revision 5.30 of OpusComm, there is internal support
for the 16550A UART chip.  This means that those of you that have the
chip installed no longer need to run the 16550.EXE program to enable
its special features.  OpusComm uses the chip in fully buffered mode
(with more buffering than was allowed with the 16550.EXE program).

The entire FOSSIL revision 5 specification is supported as described
in the files FOSSIL.CHT and FOSSIL.DOC contained in FOSSILV5.ARC. 
Previous versions of OpusComm did not support the full FOSSIL
specification, but versions 5.20 and higher support everything
described in the FOSSIL documents.
