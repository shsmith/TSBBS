Call VXFIX1.EXE immediately after running HSLINK.EXE.  This program will
read the DSZLOG file, if any, and replace it with a new file that
contains only successful transfer entries.  All entries for aborted
files will be removed from the log.  This program may fix a bug in the
way Vision/X handles hslink transfers.  Use at your own risk.  Source
code included. Freeware by Samuel H. Smith.
